 WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH ENGAGEMENT WITH COMMUNITY PARTNER
 ORGANIZATIONS. TO REALIZE THIS FOUNDATIONAL OBJECTIVE, WE WILL EMPLOY MULTIPLE BEST PRACTICES
 FOR COMMUNITY-ENGAGED PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH (CHEVALIER & BUCKLES, 2019). A KEY
 STRATEGY WILL BE THE STRATEGIC USE OF REGULAR MEETINGS WITH COMMUNITY PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS AND
 AN ONGOING, CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH EACH SITEÃ‚  S DESIGNATED COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH
 COORDINATOR (CRC), PRIOR TO AND DURING ALL DATA COLLECTION. OBJECTIVE 2: CHARACTERIZE HOW
 COMMUNITY MEMBERS VIEW RECOVERY AND SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE, AND HOW THEY ASSESS
 PROGRESS MADE TOWARD RECOVERY. WE ANTICIPATE THAT RECOVERY, FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF
 PARTICIPANTS, WILL INCLUDE BOTH SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL COMPONENTS, AND THAT THESE WILL BE
 INTERLINKED (HYPOTHESIS 2A). THIS WILL LIKELY INCLUDE CREATING MORE FIRE-RESILIENT LANDSCAPES,
 INCLUDING EXPEDITED AND PRIORITIZED IMPLEMENTATION OF FIRE RISK REDUCTION AND RESTORATION
 PROJECTS (HYPOTHESIS 2B). HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT RECOVERY OBJECTIVES AND EFFORTS TOWARD
 SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE WILL VARY BY COMMUNITY, WITH SOME DEFINING RECOVERY AS ESSENTIALLY A
 RETURN TO A PRE-FIRE STATE, AND OTHERS DEFINING IT AS WORKING TOWARD FIRE-ADAPTED COMMUNITIES. WE
 ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT ADVANCED PREPARATION (SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL) WILL INFLUENCE HOW
 COMMUNITIES RECOVER POST-FIRE, INCLUDING THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS RESOURCES AND IMPLEMENT PROJECTS
 (HYPOTHESIS 2C). THE TRAJECTORY OF COMMUNITIES IN THEIR LONG-TERM RECOVERY WILL LIKELY BE
 INFLUENCED BY HOW THEY OPERATED PRIOR TO THE WILDLAND FIRE EVENT. OBJECTIVE 3: ASSESS THE EQUITY
 ISSUES OF COMMUNITY RECOVERY IN FIRE-ADAPTED LANDSCAPES, INCLUDING WHO IS IMPACTED BY PAST
 FIRES, WHO IS INVOLVED IN RECOVERY, WHO BENEFITS FROM RECOVERY EFFORTS, AND WHO HAS OR DOES NOT
 HAVE POWER IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING ADAPTIVE CAPACITY AND SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE. AS
 NOTED IN WILKINSON (2012), SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE SCHOLARS MAY OVERLOOK IMPORTANT
 MATTERS OF POWER, CONFLICT, AND CULTURE. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, WE WILL EXPLORE THE
 ANTICIPATED UNEVENNESS OF RECOVERY, ESPECIALLY THE LIKELIHOOD THAT VULNERABLE COMMUNITY
 MEMBERS MAY BE UNDERREPRESENTED IN RECOVERY EFFORTS (HYPOTHESIS 3A). OBJECTIVE 4: DESCRIBE
 THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL SOCIAL NETWORKS, INCLUDING LOCAL TO FEDERAL ORGANIZATIONS, WORKING
 TOWARD RECOVERY AND BUILDING SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE, HOW THEY INTERACT, AND HOW THEY
 IMPACT COMMUNITY RECOVERY EFFORTS.THE PARTICIPATION OF (LOCAL) COMMUNITY ACTORS AND
 ORGANIZATIONS IN THESE NETWORKS WILL LIKELY BE VITAL IN RECOVERY AND AS COMMUNITIES BUILD
 RESILIENCE, AND STATE AND FEDERAL ACTORS WILL RELY ON BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL LOCAL
 NETWORKS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES EFFECTIVELY (HYPOTHESIS 4A). WE ANTICIPATE THAT SOME
 PRE-EXISTING LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS WILL STEP UP AFTER DISASTER AND BE IMPORTANT PARTNERS IN RECOVERY,
 BUT THERE WILL ALSO BE NEWLY-FORMED GROUPS (FORMAL OR INFORMAL) THAT EMERGE AFTER DISASTER
 (BLACKMAN ET AL. 2017) (HYPOTHESIS 4B). WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT THE WILDFIRE RECOVERY PROCESS
 WILL AFFECT COMMUNITY-LEVEL SOCIAL COHESION, PERHAPS IN CONTRADICTORY WAYS, WITH SOME
 COMMUNITIES BUILDING HEIGHTENED COHESION AFTER FIRE, AND SOME EXPERIENCING INCREASED DISTRESS
 AND CONFLICT, AND SOME EXPERIENCING BOTH CONCURRENTLY (CARROLL ET AL., 2011) (HYPOTHESIS 4C).
 OBJECTIVE 5: DESCRIBE THE RESOURCES Ã‚   FINANCIAL, SOCIAL, AND HUMAN Ã‚   AVAILABLE TO FACILITATE
 COMMUNITY RECOVERY, AS WELL AS GAPS IN AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT
 SOME RESOURCES WILL BE BOLSTERED BY THE FIRE EVENT (HYPOTHESIS 5A). HOWEVER, THERE WILL LIKELY BE
 MISMATCH BETWEEN FUNDING, ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT PROJECTS (E.G., AVAILABLE WORKFORCE AND
 EQUIPMENT), AND POLICY CONSTRAINTS (HYPOTHESIS 5B). FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE POLICIES HAVE SHIFTED",assistance_sub,5/1/2023,5/1/2023,0,Single Action,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Small ($10K - $100K),0,5

THIS PROGRAM WILL INCLUDE FUNDING FROM THE AMERICORPS PROGRAM THAT CENTRAL VALLEY AHEC OVERSEES AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PARTICIPATING CVHN AND CHAISR MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS. THE GOAL OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPLEMENT A TRAINING TO EDUCATE INDIVIDUALS FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO BECOME COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. THE TARGET AUDIENCE THAT THESE CHWS WILL PROVIDE SERVICES TO ARE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING SERVED BY MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS BOTH CVHN AND CHAISR. 
 B. MEASURABLE OBJECTIVES
 OUTREACH EFFORTS WILL BE CONDUCTED WITHIN MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAISR, LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, COMMUNITY PARTNERS, COMMUNITY COLLEGES, AND UNIVERSITIES TO RECRUIT CANDIDATES OR GET NOMINATIONS FOR CANDIDATES. ALL APPLICANTS WILL COMPLETE A SURVEY MONKEY APPLICATION DESIGNED TO ENSURE DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION, THAT WILL ALLOW THE INLAND EMPIRE AHEC TO SELECT THE MOST DIVERSE COHORT.
 INITIAL PRE-SERVICE TRAINING WILL BE CONDUCTED VIRTUALLY AND PROVIDED BY CVHN. THE CURRICULUM WILL INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY 20 TOPICS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO THE SELECTED CANDIDATES. THESE TOPICS WILL INCLUDE TRAINING ON THE ROLE OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER, CHWS AS MEMBERS OF THE CARE TEAM (UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE ROLE FITS IN THE TEAM; HOW TO HELP PATIENTS IMPROVE VISIT QUALITY AND INTERDISCIPLINARY RELATIONSHIP BUILDING), CHWS AS ADVOCATES (ADVOCATING FOR PATIENTS AND TEACHING PATIENTS TO ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES AS WELL AS ADVOCATING IN THE COMMUNITY), PROVIDING DIRECT SERVICE (BASIC SCREENING TESTS, BASIC FIRST AID SERVICES) AS WELL AS TRAININGS ON SKILLS TO INCLUDE COMMUNICATION, SAFETY, DIGITAL LITERACY, HEALTH LITERACY AND MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING. UPON COMPLETION OF THE TRAINING, THE FELLOWS WILL BE PLACED INTO 1700-HOUR SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES TO GAIN EXPERIENCE AS CHWS. ONGOING TRAINING WILL TAKE PLACE THROUGHOUT THE 1700-HOUR SERVICE EXPERIENCE. 
 CHAISRÃ‚  S PARTICIPATING MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS WILL COVER THE COST OF EACH CHW FELLOW BUT WILL RECEIVE A STIPEND FROM CHAISR TO HELP WITH COSTS. THE INLAND EMPIRE AHEC PLANS TO HOST FIVE CHW FELLOWS. THE PROPOSED BUDGET WILL COVER THE COST OF MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES SUCH AS TRAINING FEES, LAPTOPS TO BE USED BY CHW FELLOWS, MILEAGE FOR SITE VISITS, AND UNLIMITED DATA PLAN FEES OR HOTSPOTS SOLUTIONS NEEDED TO STAY CONNECTED ONLINE. THESE ARE ALL ESSENTIAL ITEMS THAT THE CHW FELLOWS WILL NEED TO RENDER SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY.
 THE INLAND EMPIRE AHEC IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY AHEC WILL ENSURE THAT THE CHW PROGRAM CURRICULUM CORRELATES WITH A FEW AHEC SCHOLAR CORE TOPICS. EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS USED IN THE CHW PROGRAM CAN EITHER BE DIRECTLY USED TO AUGMENT SIX AHEC SCHOLAR MODULES OR WILL BE USED AS THE FOUNDATION TO DEVELOP FUTURE CHW FOCUSED TRAININGS. THESE SIX AHEC SCHOLAR MODULES WILL BE SELECTED AFTER THE CHW TRAINING TAKES PLACES AND THE MATERIALS ARE EVALUATED TO SELECT THE MOST APPROPRIATE MODULE.

 COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER (CHW) TRAINING PROPOSAL Ã‚   CARRYOVER FUNDING
 THE CENTRAL VALLEY AHEC (CV-AHEC) PLANS TO LAUNCH AN AMERICORPS/PUBLIC HEALTH CORPS/COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER (CHW) FELLOW TRAINING PROGRAM DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF CALENDAR YEAR 2023 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSOCIATION OF THE INLAND AND SOUTHERN REGION (CHAISR). THE PROGRAM INCLUDES FUNDING FROM THE AMERICORPS PROGRAM AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PARTICIPATING CVHN AND CHAISR MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS. THE APPROACH FOR THIS WORK WILL INCLUDE THE IDENTIFICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A 100-PLUS HOURS TRAINING PROGRAM TO DEVELOP INDIVIDUALS FROM WITHIN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OFTEN CURRENTLY BEING SERVED BY HOST SITE ORGANIZATIONS (E.G., COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF BOTH CVHN AND CHAISR).
 B. MEASURABLE OBJECTIVES-
 PARTICIPANTS WILL BE RECRUITED FOR THESE ROLES THROUGH OUTREACH EFFORTS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, SCHOOLS, FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, COLLEGES, AND LOCAL BUSINESSES TO IDENTIFY AND REFER CANDIDATES TO THE PROGRAM. ALL NPHC APPLICANTS WILL GO THROUGH A STANDARDIZED SELECTION PROCESS, DESIGNED TO ENSURE DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION IN THE MAKEUP OF THE COHORT.
 INITIAL PRE-SERVICE TRAINING WILL BE CONDUCTED VIRTUALLY. THE CURRICULUM WILL INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY 20 TOPICS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO THE SELECTED CANDIDATES. THESE TOPICS WILL INCLUDE TRAINING ON THE ROLE OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER, CHWS AS MEMBERS OF THE CARE TEAM (UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE ROLE FITS IN THE TEAM; HOW TO HELP PATIENTS IMPROVE VISIT QUALITY AND INTERDISCIPLINARY RELATIONSHIP BUILDING), CHWS AS ADVOCATES (ADVOCATING FOR PATIENTS AND TEACHING PATIENTS TO ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES AS WELL AS ADVOCATING IN THE COMMUNITY), PROVIDING DIRECT SERVICE (BASIC SCREENING TESTS, BASIC FIRST AID SERVICES) AS WELL AS TRAININGS ON SKILLS TO INCLUDE COMMUNICATION, SAFETY, DIGITAL LITERACY, HEALTH LITERACY AND MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING. UPON COMPLETION OF THE TRAINING, THE FELLOWS WILL BE PLACED INTO 1700-HOUR SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES TO GAIN EXPERIENCE AS CHWS. ONGOING TRAINING WILL TAKE PLACE THROUGHOUT THE 1700-HOUR SERVICE EXPERIENCE.
 PARTICIPATING HEALTH CENTERS CONTRIBUTE $26,400 PER CHW FELLOW. MOST OF THE AMERICORPS GRANT IS USED TO COVER A PORTION OF THE CHW STIPEND WITH THE HEALTH CENTER CONTRIBUTION COVERING THE REMAINING STIPEND AMOUNT, HEALTH INSURANCE AND OTHER STATUTORY BENEFITS, A LAPTOP, TRAINING, AND PROGRAM FEES. IT IS THE CV-AHEC GOAL TO SEEK FUNDING RESOURCES TO REDUCE THE HEALTH CENTER CONTRIBUTION BY SECURING ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO COVER THE COST OF THE TRAINING FEES, PURCHASE OF LAPTOP, HOTSPOT, AND MONTHLY COMMUNICATION FEES (E.G., WI-FI).
 THE CHW CURRICULUM WILL ALIGN WITH SOME OF THE KEY AHEC SCHOLAR TOPICS AND MATERIALS FROM THE CURRICULUM MAY BE EITHER, DIRECTLY USED TO AUGMENT SIX AHEC SCHOLAR MODULES OR WILL BE USED AS THE FOUNDATION TO DEVELOP CHW FOCUSED TRAININGS (WEBINARS, LITERATURE, ETC.) INITIAL LEARNINGS FROM THE FIRST COHORTÃ‚  S SERVICE ACTIVITIES WILL BE USED TO INFORM THE ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED TO AUGMENT THE MODULES.

 OUR PLAN IS FOR DAN TO BE IN THE OU LAB FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE HE ENTERS A PHD PROGRAM IN THE FALL OF 
 2024. WE DEVELOPED THREE MAIN GOALS FOR HIS TIME IN THE OU LAB. FIRST, DAN WILL BECOME FACILE AT 
 THE TECHNIQUES WE COMMONLY USE IN THE LAB IN PREPARATION TO PURSUE AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH PROJECT 
 INVESTIGATING AND OVERCOMING THE BARRIERS TO RGC TRANSPLANTATION IN MOUSE AND NON-HUMAN PRIMATE 
 (NHP) EXPERIMENTAL GLAUCOMA. THIS WILL ALLOW HIM TO GAIN EXPERIENCE WITH CUTTING-EDGE TECHNIQUES 
 SUCH AS HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGING AND QUANTIFICATION OF NEURONS AND SYNAPSES, CONTINUE TO DEVELOP 
 CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS, AND WORK TOWARD A PUBLICATION. SECOND, HE WILL GAIN EXPERIENCE 
 COMMUNICATING HIS FINDINGS BY PRESENTING HIS WORK AT LAB MEETINGS AND WORK-IN-PROGRESS WORKSHOPS IN 
 THE DEPARTMENT, ATTENDING SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS, AND CO-AUTHORING PUBLICATIONS OF HIS WORK. THIRD, 
 DAN WILL JOIN THE UCSF PROPEL (POST-BACCALAUREATE RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE EQUITY IN 
 LEARNING) PROGRAM, WHICH WILL HELP HIM DEVELOP A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHD AND INDEPENDENT 
 INVESTIGATOR CAREER PATH, PARTICIPATE IN WRITING WORKSHOPS, JOURNAL CLUBS, AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT 
 WORKSHOPS, AND ALSO GAIN ACCESS TO A FACULTY CO-MENTOR. I MENTORED A PRIOR PROPEL STUDENT FOR TWO 
 YEARS, TONATIUH GARCIA RUIZ, WHO WAS ALSO A RECIPIENT OF A DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT FOR A DIFFERENT 
 PARENT GRANT, AND HAS NOW MATRICULATED INTO A NEUROSCIENCE PHD PROGRAM AT NYU IN THE FALL OF 2022. 
 MY EXPECTATION IS THAT DAN WILL SUCCEED IN HIS GOALS AS WELL.

 SUCCESSFULLY AND RECEIVED TENURE AND PROMOTION TO THE PROFESSOR LEVEL IN 2022. DR. OU IS DEEPLY 
 COMMITTED TO THE TRAINING OF STUDENTS AND TRAINEES, SERVING AS VICE CHAIR FOR POSTGRADUATE 
 EDUCATION IN THE DEPARTMENT OF OPHTHALMOLOGY SINCE 2018. SHE IS ALSO THE CO-PI OF THE UCSF-PROCTOR

 GRADUATE STUDENTS AND 2 POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS (SEE TABLE 1). THE POST-BACCALAUREATE STUDENTS HAVE 
 GONE ONTO GRADUATE SCHOOL OR MEDICAL SCHOOL AFTER ACQUIRING 2 YEARS OF RESEARCH EXPERIENCE IN THE

 AND THE PHYSICIAN AFFILIATE GROUP OF NEW YORK (PAGNY). THE CENTER IS INCLUSIVE OF THREE SYNERGISTIC PROJECTS 
 THAT FOCUS ON NOVEL INTERVENTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY AND NYP HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS EMPLOYING THE COMMUNITY 
 HEALTH WORKER (CHW) MODEL FOR ENROLLMENT AND/OR RETENTION INTO THE STUDIES WHILE ALSO CONNECTING PARTICIPANTS 
 TO SERVICES BASED ON FIVE DOMAINS OF SDOH (HOUSING INSTABILITY, FOOD INSECURITY, TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS, UTILITY 
 HELP NEEDS AND INSURANCE ENROLLMENT). THE THREE PROJECTS ARE 1) COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS UNITED TO REDUCE 
 COLORECTAL CANCER AND CVD AMONG PEOPLE AT HIGHER RISK (CHURCH); 2) ADDRESSING SLEEP DURATION, 
 REGULARITY, AND EFFICIENCY: A MULTIDIMENSIONAL SLEEP HEALTH INTERVENTION FOR REDUCING ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN 
 CARDIOMETABOLIC DISEASE (DREAM); AND 3) INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE ADHERENCE EQUITABLY (IMPACT TRIAL). IN 
 ADDITION TO THE THREE RESEARCH PROJECTS, THE CENTER WILL SUPPORT 50 PILOTS (30 FUNDED THROUGH NIMHD, 20 
 INSTITUTIONALLY) FUNDED THROUGH THE INVESTIGATOR DEVELOPMENT CORE (IDC) AND 50 COMMUNITY PROJECTS FUNDED 
 THROUGH THE COMMUNITY CORE (KNOWN AS THE CONNECTOME) FOR CAPACITY-BUILDING (BUILDING UPSTREAM 
 INFRASTRUCTURE FOR LEARNING AND DISSEMINATION; BUILD GRANTS). THE CENTER WILL ALSO BE SUPPORTED BY THE 
 ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (ADMIN) WHICH INCLUDES FACULTY WITH EXPERTISE IN BIOSTATISTICS, IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE, AND

 OWN DEVELOPMENT NEEDS. THROUGH A RIGOROUS COMMUNITY-BASED DEVELOPMENT (CBD)
 APPROACH, THE PROJECT WILL STRENGTHEN THE VOICES OF UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS (INCLUDING
 WOMEN, POOR, INDIGENOUS, YOUTH, AND OTHERS) AND ACTIVELY ENGAGE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS
 PARTICIPANTS AND LEADERS IN THE FULL CYCLE OF DESIGN, MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATION OF
 DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE PROJECT WILL WORK TO DISMANTLE THE SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND HISTORICAL
 DIVIDES THAT HAVE MARGINALIZED INDIGENOUS MAYANS IN THE WESTERN HIGHLANDS.
 THROUGH THE COMMUNITY-LED DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLANS
 (CDPS), THE PROJECT WILL SUPPORT A BROAD RANGE OF ACTIVITIES THAT FALL WITHIN THE MANDATES OF
 THE MULTIPLE FUNDING STREAMS OF USAID/GUATEMALA. THE PROJECT WILL SUPPORT CROSS-SECTORIAL
 DEVELOPMENT [FROM EXPANDING ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER AND QUALITY EDUCATION, IMPROVING
 ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR RURAL FAMILIES, AND CREATING PUBLIC SPACES FOR
 CIVIL SOCIETY ENGAGEMENT] THAT ADDRESSES THE UNDERLYING DETERMINANTS OF COMMUNITY WELLBEING. AS A RESULT, THE PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO SUSTAINABLE RURAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH
 IMPROVEMENTS IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, NUTRITION, ADAPTATION TO
 THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, INCLUSION, AND GENDER EQUITY.
 THE PROJECT WILL ALSO ENGAGE GUATEMALAN PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES (IN THE WESTERN HIGHLANDS
 AND AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL) INCLUDING BOTH THOSE ALREADY SUPPORTING COMMUNITY-LEVEL
 DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN THE WESTERN HIGHLANDS, AND THOSE NOT YET ENGAGED. THIS WILL

CHILDHOOD DISEASES GREATLY IMPACT ADULT HEALTH, AND ALARMINGLY, RATES OF CHILD MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND OBESITY ARE INCREASING, PARTICULARLY FOR YOUTH OF COLOR. MYRIAD EARLY LIFE RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS, OFTEN INEQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED AND MADE MORE STRIKING BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THESE OUTCOMES; HOWEVER, WITHOUT LARGE NATIONAL SAMPLES AND SYSTEMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF PRIORITY FACTORS, CLEAR TARGETS FOR PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS REMAIN ELUSIVE. TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL ISSUES, OUR INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM LEVERAGES THE UNIQUE POWER OF ECHO COHORT DATA TO CONDUCT ENVIRONMENT-WIDE SCANS FOR EARLY LIFE PREDICTORS OF ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION AND OBESITY TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE THE MOST POWERFUL TARGETS FOR PREVENTION, WITH A FOCUS ON SEX-SPECIFIC ASSOCIATIONS AND IMPROVING CAUSAL INFERENCE (AIM 1).

ADVOCATES WILL SERVE THE AREA I, II, AND III COURTS IN BUTLER COUNTY, OH. COURTROOM ADVOCACY IS CRUCIAL FOR VICTIMS OF DV TO STAY INFORMED AND INVOLVED WITH THE CRIMINAL COURT PROCEEDINGS. WITH THE OVERWHELMING QUANTITY OF CASES FILTERING THROUGH MISDEMEANOR COURT, ADVOCATES ARE ESSENTIAL IN NAVIGATING VICTIMS THROUGH THE PROCESS AND PROVIDING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. ADVOCATES WILL ENSURE VICTIMS ARE AWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS, ACCURATELY EXPLAIN PROCEDURES, AND REGULARLY PROVIDE CASE UPDATES. SUBSEQUENTLY, THIS WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN VICTIM PARTICIPATION, PROSECUTION OF OFFENDERS, AND OVERALL WELL-BEING. A SPECIAL FOCUS WILL BE CENTERED ON UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS SUCH AS THE INDIVIDUALS WITH LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND INADEQUATELY SERVED POPULATIONS IN THE LGBTQIA+ COMMUNITY. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE LGBTQIA+ COMMUNITY IS AT A HIGHER RISK OF VICTIMIZATION THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE APPROPRIATE SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING VICTIMS ENCOUNTER GREATER DISADVANTAGES WHEN REPORTING DV AND SEEKING ASSISTANCE THAN INDIVIDUALS WHO SPEAK ENGLISH. THE BCSO VAP IS DEDICATED TO SERVING THE LGBTQIA+ COMMUNITY AND NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING VICTIMS BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO INTERPRETATION SERVICES, TRANSLATED PROGRAM MATERIALS, PERSONAL SAFETY PLANNING, AND REFERRALS TO CULTURALLY SENSITIVE RESOURCES. OUR VISION IS TO ENSURE THAT UNDERSERVED/INADEQUATELY SERVED VICTIMS VOICES ARE HEARD WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM DESPITE THE HEIGHTENED BARRIERS THEY FACE. WITH THE COMPASSIONATE SUPPORT FROM OUR ADVOCATES, OUR HOPE IS THAT VICTIMS WILL FEEL EMPOWERED AND BEGIN THEIR HEALING JOURNEY. WITH OUR ASSISTANCE, THEY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE NECESSARY RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THEY DESIRE. IF OUR PROGRAM DOES NOT RECEIVE THIS FUNDING, VICTIMS' VOICES WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED, ABUSERS WILL NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE, AND THE CYCLE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WILL CONTINUE IN OUR COMMUNITY.

 ACCESS AND BENEFIT FROM RECOVERY SUPPORT SERVICES. WITHIN THE SPECIFIC CONTEXT OF PEER RECOVERY 
 SUPPORT SERVICES, THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION (DEI) CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. 
 DEI PRINCIPLES ARE NOT JUST A MATTER OF IDEOLOGY; THEY ARE INTEGRAL TO ENSURING THAT THESE SERVICES 
 ARE ACCESSIBLE, CULTURALLY SENSITIVE, AND DELIVERED EQUITABLY. THE FUNDAMENTAL ESSENCE OF PEER 
 SUPPORT RELIES ON BUILDING CONNECTIONS AND FOSTERING UNDERSTANDING, AND THIS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED 
 WHEN DEI IS PRIORITIZED. OUR STRATEGIC APPROACH IS DEEPLY COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING 
 COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIES TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO THE REALM OF PEER RECOVERY SUPPORT SERVICES. THIS 
 INCLUDES INITIATIVES AIMED AT FOSTERING DIVERSITY AMONG PEER SUPPORT PROVIDERS, ENSURING THAT 
 SUPPORT SERVICES ARE CULTURALLY SENSITIVE AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT, AND PROMOTING AN INCLUSIVE 
 ENVIRONMENT WHERE INDIVIDUALS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS CAN FIND THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. OUR PROPOSAL 
 SEEKS TO ENHANCE DEI WITHIN PEER RECOVERY SUPPORT SERVICES AND RECOVERY COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS 
 (RCOS), RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR ACHIEVING NOT ONLY EQUALITY BUT ALSO EFFICACY IN 
 SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR RECOVERY JOURNEYS.

 OVERVIEW:
 THE EVOLVING GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGES AND FOSSIL FUEL RESOURCE DEPLETION MANDATE REPLACEMENT OF PETROLEUM-BASED FUELS WITH BIOFUELS. SIMULTANEOUSLY, PLASTIC WASTES IMPOSE A MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGE DUE TO LOW RECYCLING RATES (~15%), HIGH ANNUAL PRODUCTION (>350 MILLION TONS), AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERSISTENCE. TECHNICAL ADVANCES CAN ADDRESS BOTH CHALLENGES.
 
 THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE MAJOR FACTORS THAT CAUSE CELL-TO-CELL VARIABILITY IN BIOPRODUCTION OF BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS AND TO DEVELOP TOOLS TO REDUCE SUCH VARIABILITY, THEREFORE IMPROVING BIOCONVERSION EFFICIENCY AND BATCH-TO-BATCH REPRODUCIBILITY. THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON TWO INDUSTRIALLY-RELEVANT MICROBIAL SPECIESÃ‚  P. PUTIDA AND R. OPACUSÃ‚  FOR THEIR PRODUCTION OF BIODEGRADABLE PLASTIC PRECURSOR (PHA) AND BIODIESEL PRECURSOR (LIPIDS), RESPECTIVELY. THE SUCCESS FACTORS ARE TO PROVIDE SYSTEMATIC AND QUANTITATIVE UNDERSTANDING ON THE SOURCES OF VARIABILITY IN THESE BIOCONVERSION SYSTEMS. THE TARGETED PERFORMANCE IS TO DEVELOP TOOLS THAT CAN REDUCE CELL-TO-CELL VARIABILITY, AS QUANTIFIED USING NOISE (ÃŽÂ·2, I.E. SQUARE OF COEFFICIENT OF VARIANCE) OF SINGLE-CELL PRODUCT CONCENTRATION, BY AT LEAST 60%. AND THIS REDUCTION ON BIOPRODUCTION VARIABILITY WILL LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS OF TITERS AND YIELDS BY AT LEAST 100% BY THE END OF THE PROJECT PERIOD. THE RESULTANT TEAM EFFORT WILL PROVIDE MULTIDISCIPLINARY SUPPORT FOR BETOÃ‚  S (BIOENERGY TECHNOLOGIES OFFICE) MISSION ON DEVELOPING COMMERCIAL-SCALE BIOREFINERIES OF AFFORDABLE BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE SPECIFIC MISSION OF THIS FOA FUNDING OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT) (ON IMPROVING THE ROBUSTNESS OF MICROBIAL BIOCONVERSION.
 
 
 OBJECTIVES:
 
 TASK 3: DEVELOP TOOLS TO REDUCE AND REGULATE CELL-TO-CELL VARIATION (ZHANG, LI).
 TASK SUMMARY: THIS TASK WILL DEVELOP COMPUTATIONAL MODELS TO SIMULATE SEVERAL GENE CIRCUITS WITH DIFFERENT REGULATORY TOPOLOGIES ON THEIR ABILITIES IN REDUCING BIOPRODUCTION VARIATION AS WELL AS IMPROVING OVERALL CONVERSION YIELD AND PRODUCTIVITY. TO EXPERIMENTALLY IMPLEMENT THESE GENE CIRCUITS AS WELL AS REDUCING THE MAJOR NOISE SOURCE(S) AS IDENTIFIED FROM TASK 2, THIS TASK WILL ALSO DEVELOP GENETIC TOOLS TO REDUCE THE VARIABILITY OF ENZYMES, METABOLIC PRECURSORS/INTERMEDIATE, THEREBY IMPROVING THE ROBUSTNESS OF CONVERSION.
 SUBTASK 3.1 MODELING THE EFFECT OF GENE CIRCUITS ON HETEROGENEITY REDUCTION. (ZHANG, LI). 
 SUBTASK SUMMARY: GENE CIRCUITS THAT CAN DIFFERENTIATE SUBPOPULATIONS (E.G. POPQC) CAN ENRICH HIGH-PRODUCING CELLS AND IMPROVE OVERALL TITERS AND YIELD. POPULATION-DIFFERENTIABLE GENE CIRCUITS (PODGCS) CAN BE BUILT IN NUMEROUS WAYS TO EITHER SELECT CELLS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF PATHWAY ENZYME OR CELLS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF BIOPRODUCT5,19. DIFFERENT SELECTION STRATEGIES MAY RESULT IN DIFFERENT PRODUCTION PERFORMANCE DEPENDING ON THEIR PARAMETERS, RESPONSE TIME, AND THE FLUCTUATION DYNAMICS OF THE PRODUCTS. TO EXPLORE WHICH TYPE OF PODGC AND PARAMETER SETTINGS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING HETEROGENEITY AND IMPROVING OVERALL TITERS, YIELDS, AND PRODUCTIVITIES, THIS SUBTASK WILL DEVELOP COMPUTATIONAL MODELS TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PODGCS.
  
 FIG 7. COMPUTATIONAL MODELS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF GENE CIRCUITS ON HETEROGENEITY REDUCTION.  (A) MODEL-SIMULATED SINGLE-CELL METABOLITE (ÃŽÂ²-XANTHIN) CONCENTRATION TRAJECTORIES (BOTTOM) ARE CONSISTENT WITH EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS (TOP). (B) MODELED DISTRIBUTION OF SINGLE-CELL ÃŽÂ²-XANTHIN CONCENTRATION IS CONSISTENT WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA. (C) MODELED ENZYME-METABOLITE CROSS-CORRELATION CURVE IS COMPARED TO THAT OF CALCULATED FROM EXPERIMENTAL DATA. (D-G) PROPOSED PODGCS TO STUDY THEIR EFFECTS ON VARIABILITY REDUCTION. 
 SUBTASK DETAILS: WE WILL FIRST DEVELOP A STOCHASTIC MODEL FRAMEWORK FOR SINGLE CELL METABOLITE PRODUCTION BASED ON A SIMPLIFIED PATHWAY (E.G. THE FA BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAY, FIG 3A) SIMILAR TO A PUBLISHED STOCHASTIC MODEL BUT USING OUR EXPERIMENTAL DATA FOR PARAMETERIZATION45. THE MODEL WILL CONSIDER, IN A SINGLE CELL, STOCHASTIC ENZYME EXPRESSION, METABOLITE PRODUCTION BY ENZYMATIC REACTIONS, A GROWTH FACTOR TO REPRESENT THE CELLÃ‚  S OVERALL METABOLIC STATE FOR STOCHASTIC SIMULATION, PODGC COMPONENTS (E.G. A SELECTOR PROTEIN), AND DILUTION BY CELL GROWTH. STOCHASTIC GILLESPIE SIMULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED TO EXAMINE THE FLUCTUATION OF EACH MOLECULAR SPECIES IN A SINGLE CELL, AND MULTIPLE HUNDREDS OF CELLS WILL BE SIMULATED TO OBTAIN CELL-TO-CELL HETEROGENEITY INFORMATION45. WITHIN EACH CYCLE, THE SIMULATION WILL ACCOUNT FOR INCREASES IN CELL SIZE ACCORDING TO THE GROWTH RATE, WHICH WILL BE CALCULATED AT EACH TIME STEP USING A HILL FUNCTION OF THE GROWTH FACTOR. THE OVERALL FERMENTATION YIELD AND TITER WILL BE CALCULATED BY CONSIDERING THE DEPLETION OF CARBON SOURCE FROM THE ENTIRE CELL POPULATION USING THE MONOD EQUATION. THE MODEL WILL BE PARAMETERIZED USING EXPERIMENTALLY MEASURED ENZYME EXPRESSION NOISE VALUES AS WELL AS PUBLISHED LITERATURE VALUES ON ENZYME AND GROWTH KINETICS16. PREVIOUSLY, WE HAVE APPLIED SUCH STOCHASTIC MODEL TO SIMULATE THE BIOPRODUCTION OF ÃŽÂ²-XANTHIN (A FLUORESCENCE DYE) IN E. COLI, AND HAVE OBTAINED EXCELLENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN SIMULATED HETEROGENEITY CHARACTERISTICS WITH EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS (FIG 7A-C).
 USING THIS STOCHASTIC MODEL FRAMEWORK, WE WILL THEN STUDY THE EFFECTS OF 4 DIFFERENT PODGCS ON REDUCING BIOPRODUCTION HETEROGENEITY (FIG 7D-G). (I) ENZYME-FEEDBACK-TO-GROWTH COUPLES SINGLE-CELL ENZYME EXPRESSION NOISE TO THE EXPRESSION OF A SELECTION GENE THAT WILL BE USED TO ACTIVATE CELL GROWTH. (II) GROWTH-FEEDBACK-TO-EXPRESSION COUPLES THE NOISE OF GROWTH FACTOR TO THE EXPRESSION OF PATHWAY ENZYME. (III) METABOLITE-FEEDBACK-TO-GROWTH COUPLES THE NOISE OF METABOLITE PRODUCT TO CELL GROWTH. AND (IV) METABOLITE-FEEDBACK-TO-EXPRESSION COUPLES THE NOISE OF METABOLITE PRODUCT TO THE EXPRESSION OF ITS OWN PATHWAY ENZYME. HETEROGENEOUS METABOLITE BIOPRODUCTION UNDER THE CONTROL OF THESE 4 PODGCS WILL BE SIMULATED. THE RESULTING VARIABILITY ON METABOLITE CONCENTRATION AND OVERALL FERMENTATION TITER, YIELD, AND PRODUCTIVITY WILL BE COMPARED TO THOSE WITHOUT PODGC. THE MOST EFFECTIVE PODGC WILL BE IDENTIFIED.
 
 MILESTONE 3.1.1: COMPUTATIONALLY QUANTIFY THE FOLD OF ENHANCEMENT ON FERMENTATION TITER, YIELD, AND RATE FOR 4 DIFFERENT PODGCS FROM NON-STRAIN-SPECIFIC MODELS
 MILESTONE 3.1.2: IDENTIFY THE BEST PODGC THAT CAN ENHANCE CONVERSION YIELD BY >100%, TITER BY >200% AND RATE BY >200%.
 
 SUBTASK 3.3 DEVELOP TOOLS TO REDUCE VARIABILITY ON METABOLITE ABUNDANCE (ZHANG, LI). 
 SUBTASK SUMMARY: IN THIS SUBTASK, WE WILL DEVELOP TOOLS TO REDUCE VARIABILITY ON KEY METABOLITES, TAKING ACYL-ACP AS AN EXAMPLE. NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS WILL BE BUILT TO CONTROL ACYL-COA BIOSYNTHESIS. THE ACYL-COA SENSOR WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF VARIABILITY REDUCTION. 
 SUBTASK DETAILS: NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOP (NFL) HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE GENE EXPRESSION NOISE, BUT IT HAS NEVER BEEN USED TO REDUCE METABOLITE NOISE47. WE WILL CONSTRUCT METABOLIC NFLS TO REGULATED ACYL-COA CONCENTRATION BY USING THE ACYL-COA-RESPONSIVE PROMOTER TO CONTROL THE EXPRESSION OF MAJOR ACYL-COA BIOSYNTHETIC GENES. MEANWHILE, THE STRENGTH OF FEEDBACK WILL BE TUNED BY VARYING THE STRENGTH OF ACYL-COA-ACTIVATED PROMOTERS. THE NFL DESIGN PRINCIPLE WILL BE FIRST VALIDATED IN E. COLI BY CONTROLLING ACYL-COA SYNTHASE (FADD, FIG 8B) EXPRESSION. ACYL-COA NFL WILL THEN BY TESTED IN P. PUTIDA AND R. OPACUS BY CONTROLLING FABI AND FASI (FIG 8C), RESPECTIVELY.   
 EXPECTED RESULT: WE EXPECT TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF 4 PODGC ON BIOPRODUCTION, WITH THE BEST PODGC TO ENHANCE TITER/YIELD/RATE BY >100% AS SHOWN IN TABLE 1. WE ALSO EXPECT TO CREATE AND CHARACTERIZE NAR PROMOTERS AND NFLS THAT CAN REDUCE ENZYME EXPRESSION NOISE AND ACYL-COA NOISE BY >60%, RESPECTIVELY. SUCH RESULTS WILL CONSTANTLY FEED TO TASK 4 FOR TEA/LCA CALCULATIONS.
 
 MILESTONE 3.3: CREATE NFL TOOLS THAT CAN SENSE THE INTRACELLULAR CONCENTRATION OF ACYL-COA AND NEGATIVELY FEEDBACK REGULATE THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF ACYL-COA, THUS REDUCING CELL-TO-CELL VARIABILITY OF ACYL-COA. THE SPECIFIC MILESTONE IS TO REDUCE ACYL-COA NOISE BY >60% FROM UNREGULATED MODEL E. COLI STRAINS.

THOSE STUDENTS WILL CONVEY WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED AT WASHU BACK TO THEIR CLASSMATES AT PVAMU; THAT MAY ENCOURAGE MORE STUDENTS TO BECOME INTERESTED IN GRADUATE STUDIES. WE WILL PRESENT OUR FINDINGS TO THE BIOENGINEERING/CHEMICAL ENGINEERING PROGRAM AT PVAMU AS WELL AS OTHER HBCUS AND INTRODUCE OUR GRADUATE PROGRAMS TO THEIR STUDENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT RECRUITMENT PRACTICE AT EACH INSTITUTION, THE TEAM PLANS TO CONNECT WITH OTHER MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS FOR STUDENT RECRUITMENT. WE EXPECT URG STUDENTS WILL DEVELOP PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP AND LEVERAGE THAT FOR POTENTIAL CAREER PATH SUCH AS GRADUATE SCHOOL. 
 OBJECTIVE 2: DISSEMINATE RESEARCH RESULTS TO URGS INTERESTED IN PURSUING STEM CAREERS
 PROJECT LEADERSHIP WILL PRESENT AND PARTICIPATE IN SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCES FOR URGS, SUCH AS THE AFROBIOTECH CONFERENCE AND THE NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR BLACK ENGINEERS. BESIDES LEADERSHIP PRESENTATION, WE WILL ALSO SUPPORT A NUMBER OF URG STUDENTS TO GO TO THE CONFERENCE, WHERE THEY CAN LEARN ABOUT THE SCIENCE AND POTENTIAL CAREER PATHWAYS. IN ADDITION, THE RESEARCH RESULTS WILL BE DISSEMINATED THROUGH OTHER PLATFORMS FOR A BROADER IMPACT ON URGS. SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE BECOME A VERY EFFECTIVE AND ATTRACTIVE PLATFORM FOR DISSEMINATING NEW RESEARCH. THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS EQUIPPED US TO GET USED TO VIRTUAL MEETINGS/SEMINAR/TEACHING AND TO REALIZE SOME BENEFITS OF VIRTUAL APPROACHES: EASY ACCESS TO THE AUDIENCES. THUS, VIRTUAL SEMINARS/PRESENTATIONS WILL BE EMPLOYED TO DISSEMINATE THE RESEARCH RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT WHEN THERE ARE APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITIES/EVENTS. THE PI OR THE GRADUATE STUDENTS WILL UNDERTAKE TO ENGAGE IN SUCH PRESENTATIONS AND INTRODUCE SUSTAINABLE BIOPRODUCTION TO K-12 STUDENTS. PARTICULARLY, WE WILL ENSURE THE SCIENCE TEACHERS OF K12 STUDENTS ARE ADEQUATELY PREPARED. A TEACHER CAN POTENTIALLY INFLUENCE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STUDENTS INCLUDING THOSE IN URGS. IF FUNDED, WE WILL CONTINUE INVOLVE K12 TEACHERS IN OUR Ã‚  HOT TOPICS IN SYNTHETIC BIOLOGYÃ‚   WORKSHOPS AT WUSTL, SELECTED FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVING A LARGE PORTION OF URG STUDENTS. THEY TEACHERS WILL BE INTRODUCED KEY CONCEPT AND THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART IN BIOREFINERIES. 
 OBJECTIVE 3: WORK WITH LOCAL INDUSTRIES TO DEVELOP A PATHWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGIES TO DIRECTLY BENEFIT AN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY
 THE ST. LOUIS REGION HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS IN URGS. THE POPULATION OF ST. LOUIS CITY WAS ABOUT 49.2% BLACK, 43.9% WHITE (42.2% NON-HISPANIC WHITE), 2.9% ASIAN, 0.3% NATIVE AMERICAN/ALASKA NATIVE, AND 2.4% REPORTING TWO OR MORE RACES. IN ST. LOUIS COUNTY, THE POPULATION CONSISTS OF 68.3% WHITE, 35.3% AFRICAN AMERICAN, 0.2% NATIVE AMERICAN, 3.5% ASIAN, 0.03% PACIFIC ISLANDER, 0.9% FROM OTHER RACES, AND 1.9% FROM TWO OR MORE RACES AND 2.5% HISPANIC OR LATINO. THE WUSTL TEAM WILL WORK WITH LOCAL INDUSTRIES TO TRANSLATE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH TO PRACTICAL TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL BENEFIT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY SERVING UNDERSERVED POPULATION. THE TEAM WILL PRESENT THE RESEARCH FINDINGS TO ACS ST. LOUIS REGIONAL MEETINGS AND EVENTS, RECEIVE FEEDBACK ABOUT OUR WORK, INVOLVE ST. LOUIS REGIONAL PARTNERS, AND DISCUSS PATHWAYS FOR TECHNOLOGY LICENSING, TRANSFER, AND COLLABORATION BEYOND THIS DOE PROJECT. WE WILL IDENTIFY MINORITY BUSINESS ENTERPRISES, MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES, WOMAN OWNED BUSINESSES AND VETERAN OWNED BUSINESSES TO SOLICIT AS COLLABORATOR OR PARTNERS TO USE OUR DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES. THE TEAM WILL WORK WITH THE WASHU OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT ON PARTNERSHIP (E.G. NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT), IP LICENSING, AND TRANSFER.

 MINORITIES IN THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM. TRINITY IS A MINORITY
 SERVING INSTITUTION (MSI) AND PREDOMINANTLY BLACK INSTITUTION (PBI) FOR PURPOSES OF U.S.
 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TITLE III GRANTS. THESE CLASSIFICATIONS UNDERSCORE TRINITYÃ‚  S COMMITMENT
 TO SERVING STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED ECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL MARGINALIZATION.
 MORE THAN HALF OF TRINITYÃ‚  S STUDENTS ARE RESIDENTS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, WITH MOST COMING
 FROM THE EASTERN HALF OF THE CITY WHERE POVERTY IS HIGH AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IS LIMITED.
 TRINITY SERVES MORE D.C. RESIDENTS THAN ANY PRIVATE UNIVERSITY IN THE NATION, AND THIS COMMITMENT
 UNDERSCORES TRINITYÃ‚  S MISSION TO PROMOTE ACADEMIC SUCCESS AS A MATTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE.
 BECAUSE OF THE VERY HIGH NEED OF TRINITY STUDENTS FOR TUITION ASSISTANCE AND RELATED EDUCATION
 COSTS, COUPLED WITH TRINITYÃ‚  S OWN MODEST RESOURCES, THE UNIVERSITY IS GRATEFUL TO EXISTING PRIVATE
 SCHOLARSHIP PARTNERS THAT INCLUDE THE CLARE BOOTHE LUCE FOUNDATION SCHOLARSHIPS FOR WOMEN IN
 MATH AND SCIENCE THAT ALSO SUPPORTS OUTSTANDING FEMALE SCIENCE FACULTY. SINCE 2014, NASA DC
 SPACE GRANT HAS PROVIDED VALUABLE FUNDING TO SUPPORT STUDENT STEM RESEARCH INTERNSHIPS FOR
 UNDERGRADUATES IN THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES. BECAUSE SO MANY TRINITY STUDENTS WORK
 JOBS TO SUPPORT THEIR OWN EDUCATION, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO TAKE ON INTERNSHIPS AS UNPAID
 VOLUNTEERS. THE PROGRAM SUPPORTS TRINITY UNDERGRADUATES FINANCIALLY, SO THEY CAN SPEND THEIR
 TIME AT AN INTERNSHIP, INSTEAD OF A JOB, DURING THE SUMMER AND THE ACADEMIC YEAR, WHILE
 SIMULTANEOUSLY RECEIVING THE MOST OUT OF THEIR UNDERGRADUATE STEM CURRICULUM. WHILE MOST
 INTERNSHIP PLACEMENTS HAVE BEEN EXTERNAL, AT AREA RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS, IN RESPONSE TO THE
 RESTRICTION ON OFF-CAMPUS ACTIVITIES DURING THE PANDEMIC IN 2020, SIX TRINITY STEM FACULTY
 MEMBERS STEPPED UP TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT COULD BE
 CARRIED OUT REMOTELY.
 FOR 2021-22, TRINITY IS AGAIN SUBMITTING A PROPOSAL FOR NIFS (NASA INTERNSHIPS, FELLOWSHIPS AND
 SCHOLARSHIPS). THIS PROPOSAL REQUESTS FUNDS FOR STUDENT STIPENDS, OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO
 PRESENT THEIR WORK AT CONFERENCES, AND SUPPLIES THAT ENABLE TRINITY FACULTY TO CONTINUE THESE
 RESEARCH PROJECTS. FUNDING WILL ALSO SUPPORT WORKSHOPS AND ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO PREPARE TRINITY
 UNDERGRADUATE STEM MAJORS FOR CAREERS IN THE SCIENCES.
 NIFS: EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING FOR TRINITY UNDERGRADUATE WOMEN
 THE PROPOSED NIFS PROGRAM WILL SUPPORT TRINITY UNDERGRADUATE WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN
 INTERNSHIPS OVER THE SUMMER AND THE ACADEMIC YEAR, EITHER AT NEARBY RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS OR AT
 TRINITY, AS PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS ALLOW. STUDENTS WILL ALSO PARTICIPATE IN MENTORING ACTIVITIES TO
 SUPPORT THEIR DEVELOPMENT AS SCIENCE MAJORS AND TO OPEN DOORS FOR CAREERS IN SCIENCE.
 STUDENTS SELECTED TO RECEIVE FUNDING WILL BE NASA DC SPACE GRANT SCHOLARS. THEY WILL BE
 REQUIRED TO PREPARE A REFLECTION PIECE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE, AN ABSTRACT AND POSTER AT THE
 CONCLUSION OF THEIR INTERNSHIPS. THEIR ABSTRACTS WILL BE SUBMITTED TO CONFERENCES, LOCALLY AND
 NATIONALLY. A DIRECT MEASURE OF STUDENT LEARNING WILL BE A RUBRIC TO EVALUATE THEIR ABSTRACT AND
 POSTER PRESENTATIONS.
 
 TRINITYÃ‚  S NIFS PROGRAM FULFILLS PROPOSAL CRITERIA AS FOLLOWS.

THE PROJECT WILL ALSO DEVELOP A PRIORITIZED RESEARCH AGENDA TO ADDRESS THE ASSOCIATED CHALLENGES THROUGH HOSTING A WORKING INSTITUTE OF ACADEMIC FACULTY, DOCTORAL STUDENTS, AND GLAM PRACTITIONERS.
 THE PROJECT WILL INCORPORATE TWO MAIN PHASES AND WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: WHAT ARE THE CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED RISKS MOST LIKELY TO PROVIDE THREATS TO GLAMS? HOW CAN CLIMATE CHANGE RISK FOR GLAMS BE UNDERSTOOD AS A CATEGORICAL SCALE WHEN COMBINING THOSE THREATS MOST LIKELY TO NEED SIGNIFICANT CONSIDERATION? WHAT ARE THE GLAM-SPECIFIC CLIMATE CHANGE CHALLENGES? HOW CAN A COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AGENDA BEST ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES WITH INPUT FROM PRACTITIONERS & ACADEMICS?
 THE PROJECT IS ALSO GROUNDED IN PRIOR CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH. PRIOR GLAM RESEARCH PRIMARY FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL EVENTS OR INSTITUTIONAL TYPES. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL INCORPORATE PRIOR EXPERIENCES INTO DEFINING GLAM-RELATED THREATS AND THE PROPOSED INSTITUTE WILL CREATE COLLABORATIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES.
 THE ANALYSIS WILL UTILIZE A COMPREHENSIVE GLAM DATASET PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED BY THE PIS WITH ASSISTANCE FROM 20 STUDENTS BETWEEN 2020-2022. THE PIS LEVERAGED EXISTING LISTINGS OF INSTITUTIONS AND REPOSITORIES SUCH AS THE IMLS MUSEUM DATA FILES, THE 2017 REPOSITORY DATA FOR UNITED STATES ARCHIVES, THE AMERICAN LIBRARY DIRECTORY, AND THE IMLS PUBLIC LIBRARY SURVEY. EACH ENTRY IN THE COMBINED DATASET WAS VERIFIED OR UPDATED TO INCLUDE PHYSICAL LOCATION IF ONLY A MAILING ADDRESS WAS INITIALLY PROVIDED. THE COMPILED DATASET INCLUDES OVER 30,000 GALLERIES AND MUSEUMS, 36,000 LIBRARIES, AND 26,000 ARCHIVES COMPARED TO THE 2019 HHI DATASET THAT INCLUDED 31,290 COLLECTING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.
 THE PROJECT'S FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS WILL INHERENTLY INCORPORATE GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY. UNFORTUNATELY, MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES ARE MORE AT RISK DUE TO THEIR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS NEAR COASTS, LOW-LYING AND/OR LOW-INCOME AREAS, & IN HOTTER AREAS WITHIN CITIES. THE PROPOSED INSTITUTE IN YEAR 3 WILL PRIORITIZE PARTICIPANTS FROM MARGINALIZED & UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY THESE EXTREMES. FINALLY, STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS WILL BE GIVEN HIRING PREFERENCE FOR THE PROJECT'S POSITIONS. THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT IS UNIQUE DUE TO THE BLEND OF INFORMATION SCIENCE & CLIMATE SCIENCE, PERFECTLY POSITIONING IT TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR ENVIRONMENT WHILE ALSO LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO UTILIZE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM.
 THE ANTICIPATED FINDINGS FROM THE PROJECT'S FIRST PHASE WILL BE PUBLICLY DISSEMINATED THROUGH AN ONLINE PORTAL.

 TASK 2: DES SYSTEM DESIGN FOR DELIGNIFICATION
 TASK SUMMARY: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TASK IS TO UTILIZE DES AND DEVELOP THEIR NOVEL MODIFICATIONS TO ACHIEVE LOW TEMPERATURE DELIGNIFICATION FOR PRE-TREATMENT PURPOSES IN THE KRAFT PULPING PROCESS. SPECIFICALLY, DES WILL ATTACK THE STRONG BONDS WITHIN THE LIGNIN STRUCTURE AND FACILITATE THE SOLUBILIZATION OF LIGNIN OUT FROM THE WOOD STRUCTURE. DURING THE DES DESIGN PROCESS, A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL (MOLECULAR SIMULATIONS) APPROACH WILL BE USED TO FIND THE OPTIMAL DES CONFIGURATION TO ENHANCE DELIGNIFICATION WHILE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE CHEMICAL LOAD AND TEMPERATURE REQUIREMENT IN THE EXISTING PULP. THE OUTCOMES OF THIS TASK IS TO PROVIDE MOST SUITABLE HBA/HBD COMBINATIONS ALONG WITH THEIR OPTIMAL MOLAR MIXING RATIOS TO ACHIEVE DES BASED HIGH DELIGNIFICATION PERFORMANCE THAT CAN BE EASILY ADOPTED IN EXISTING KRAFT PULPING PROCESS THAT WILL NOT ONLY MINIMIZE THE UTILIZATION OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS, BUT ALSO REDUCE THE CO2 FOOTPRINT OF THE PROCESS SUBSTANTIALLY. THE SIMULATION AIDED (DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY, MOLECULAR DYNAMICS) DES DESIGN WILL PROVIDE THE THEORETICAL BASIS ON WHY AND HOW DES BASED DELIGNIFICATION WORK AT DESIRED CONDITIONS.

WE ELECTED TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE PI DUE TO THE MULTIFACETED NATURE OF THE REQUIRED LEADERSHIP FOR THE PROPOSED P50; OUR EQUIVALENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROPOSAL AND OUR ROLES SHOULD IT BE FUNDED; AND OUR HIGHLY COMPLEMENTARY AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY TRAINING AND RESEARCH EXPERTISE, WHICH MAP ON DIRECTLY TO THE NEEDS OF THE PROPOSED CENTER. THE MULTIPLE PIS (MPIS), DRS. BEIDAS, BEKELMAN, AND SCHOLL, WILL BE JOINTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING ALL PROJECT PLANNING, STRATEGY, AND OPERATIONS; AND EACH BRING UNIQUE EXPERTISE, INSIGHT, AND SKILLS TO THE PENN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE CENTER FOR CANCER CONTROL (PENN ISC3). THE PENN ISC3 USES A TEAM SCIENCE APPROACH TO ADDRESS THE GRAND CHALLENGE OF IMPLEMENTING EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CANCER WITH THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF IMPROVING CANCER CARE DELIVERY QUALITY AND EQUITY AND SUSTAINING A MEANINGFUL PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT. THE MPI PLAN ALSO BALANCES CONTENT AREA EXPERTISE AND GENDER EQUITY WITHIN OUR LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE. THE THREE MPIS ARE IDEALLY SUITED TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROPOSED MULTIDISCIPLINARY ACTIVITIES, BRINGING TOGETHER THEIR EXPERTISE IN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE (BEIDAS); CANCER CARE-DELIVERY AND COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH, BOTH RANDOMIZED AND NON-RANDOMIZED (BEKELMAN); AND BEHAVIORAL/POPULATION SCIENCE IN ONCOLOGY (SCHNOLL). OUR PROPOSED PENN ISC3 WILL MERGE THEORY, METHODS, AND OBJECTIVES FROM IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE INTO CLINICAL CANCER CARE CONTEXTS AT PENN MEDICINE, NECESSITATING THE COLLABORATIVE AND HIGHLY COMPLEMENTARY EXPERTISE THAT THE MPIS CAN PROVIDE TO LEAD THIS CENTER. EVIDENCE OF PRIOR COLLABORATION. DRS. BEIDAS AND SCHNOLL HAVE BEEN COLLABORATING FOR THE PAST 4 YEARS ON SEVERAL PROJECTS. FIRST, THEY HAVE COLLABORATED ON AN NCI-FUNDED CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED TRIAL (R01 CA202699) EVALUATING METHODS FOR TRAINING MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS TO TREAT NICOTINE DEPENDENCE IN PHILADELPHIA COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTHCARE CLINICS (SEE FLITTER ET AL., 2019; LUBITZ ET AL., 2019). SECOND, THEY COLLABORATED ON THE DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION, AND EVALUATION OF THE TOBACCO USE TREATMENT SERVICE, FUNDED BY THE NCI MOONSHOT (P30 CA016520-41S4) AND A CENTRAL COMPONENT OF PROJECT 1 (SEE JENSSEN ET AL., 2019). OF HIGH RELEVANCE, THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ABRAMSON CANCER CENTER (ACC) EXPLICITLY TASKED DRS. BEIDAS, BEKELMAN, AND SCHNOLL TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE INTEGRATION OF IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE AT THE ACC. IN THAT VEIN, DR. BEIDAS SERVED ON A COMMITTEE FOR THE ACC TO ADDRESS METHODS FOR IMPROVING THE USE OF EVIDENCE-BASED CARE IN ONCOLOGY. DR. BEKELMAN WAS APPOINTED TO LEAD THE PENN MEDICINE CENTER FOR CANCER CARE INNOVATION (PC3I) AT THE ACC, WHICH FOCUSES ON PILOT PROJECTS THAT EVALUATE METHODS TO IMPROVE THE USE OF EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT IN ONCOLOGY. DRS. BEIDAS AND SCHNOLL ARE INTERNAL SCIENTIFIC ADVISORS FOR PC3I. ALONG WITH DR. BEKELMAN, DR. SCHNOLL LED A STRATEGIC PLANNING INITIATIVE AT THE ACC, WHICH HAS INCORPORATED THE GROWTH OF IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE AT THE ACC AS A KEY STRATEGIC PRIORITY. RECENTLY DRS. BEIDAS AND BEKELMAN COLLABORATED ON A PAPER WHICH DR. TAKVORIAN LED THAT IS ACCEPTED (UNDER EMBARGO) AT JAMA ONCOLOGY, WHICH HAS DIRECT RELEVANCE FOR SPP2. GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE. DR. BEIDAS IS PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF PSYCHIATRY; MEDICAL ETHICS AND HEALTH POLICY; AND MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA AND DIRECTOR OF THE PENN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE CENTER AT THE LEONARD DAVIS INSTITUTE (PISCE@LDI). DR. BEIDAS WILL SHARE OVERALL SCIENTIFIC RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROJECT WITH DR. JUSTIN BEKELMAN, PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY AND MEDICAL ETHICS AND HEALTH POLICY AND DIRECTOR OF THE PENN CENTER FOR CANCER CARE INNOVATION (PC3I); AND DR. ROBERT SCHNOLL, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY, AND ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR POPULATION SCIENCE AT THE ACC. DRS. BEIDAS, BEKELMAN, AND SCHNOLL ARE IDEALLY SUITED TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEADING THE PENN ISC3. DR. BEIDAS  DISCIPLINARY TRAINING IS IN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY. SHE IS A NATIONAL EXPERT IN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE IN A RECENT SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS SHE WAS CITED AMONG THE TOP 10 INVESTIGATORS WHOM OTHERS GO TO FOR COLLABORATION AND EXPERTISE IN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE AND HAS PUBLISHED OVER 130 PAPERS ON THE TOPIC. SHE CO-LEADS AN NIH CENTER ON BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS, IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE, AND MENTAL HEALTH (P50 MH 113840) AND HAS A STRONG TRACK RECORD OF NIH-FUNDED IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH (SHE HAS SERVED AS MPI OF SIX NIH GRANTS TOTALING OVER 10 MILLION DOLLARS), OF MENTORING POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS (SHE IS AN MPI OF A T32 ON IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE FROM NIMH), AND OF BUILDING IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE CAPACITY IN HEALTH AT PENN OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS THROUGH PISCE@LDI. DR. BEKELMAN LEADS A RESEARCH PROGRAM IN DELIVERY SYSTEM AND PAYMENT REFORM AND CANCER COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH, INTEGRATING METHODS FROM THE FIELDS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY, CLINICAL TRIALS, HEALTH ECONOMICS, AND PUBLIC POLICY. HE BRINGS KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHTS FROM MORE THAN TEN YEARS OF CANCER HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH, WHICH HAS INVOLVED EXTENSIVE RESEARCH UTILIZING BOTH RANDOMIZED AND NON-RANDOMIZED PRAGMATIC COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH STUDY DESIGN. HE IS THE PI OF A LARGE-SCALE PRAGMATIC TRIAL FUNDED BY THE PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES RESEARCH INSTITUTE ( NCT02603341) AND IS ALSO FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE AND THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY. DR. SCHNOLL S DISCIPLINARY TRAINING IS IN PSYCHOLOGY AND HE HAS SPENT HIS CAREER CONDUCTING BEHAVIORAL, PHYSICIAN-BASED, AND PHARMACOLOGICAL CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SMOKING CESSATION, NATIONALLY AND GLOBALLY. DR. SCHNOLL HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE LEADING NIH FUNDED TRIALS, PARTICULARLY IN UNDERSERVED AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. HE HAS BEEN IMMERSED IN A CANCER CENTER SINCE 1998, FIRST AS AN R25 SCHOLAR AT FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER, AND NOW AS ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR POPULATION SCIENCE AT THE ACC. HE HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE COORDINATING COMPLEX STUDIES, INCLUDING MULTI-SITE CLINICAL TRIALS AND CLUSTER RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS AND HAS BEEN LEADING THE EFFORT AT THE ACC TO LEVERAGE THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD (EMR) TO IMPROVE CANCER PATIENT TREATMENT FOCUSED ON TOBACCO USE. TOGETHER, THESE THREE INDIVIDUALS MARRY THE DISCIPLINES OF BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS, IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE, AND ONCOLOGY CARE, IN THE PURSUIT OF IMPROVING CANCER CARE DELIVERY. THEIR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES, AS WELL AS ROLES OF COLLABORATORS WITH RESPECT TO THE OVERALL PROJECT, ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE CORE AND OVERALL SECTIONS. DRS. BEIDAS, BEKELMAN, AND SCHNOLL WILL PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE ENTIRE CENTER, WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTION OF ALL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THESE INCLUDE THE OVERALL SCIENTIFIC AGENDA AND STRATEGIC PLANNING OF THE CENTER (WORKING WITH THE INTERNAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND THE EXTERNAL ADVISORY BOARD), THE ADMINISTRATIVE CORE TEAM, AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH ALL DHHS AND NIH POLICIES REGARDING SAFETY AND OTHER POLICIES RELATED TO HUMAN RESEARCH. AS PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS, DRS. BEIDAS, BEKELMAN, AND SCHNOLL WILL SHARE OVERALL SCIENTIFIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE P50 ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING QUALITY ASSURANCE; FACILITATION OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AMONG THE INVESTIGATIVE TEAMS; PLANNING OF SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES; COMMUNICATION WITH EXTERNAL ENTITIES; DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS; AND ADMINISTRATIVE, BUDGETARY, AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. TO LEVERAGE STRENGTHS, AND ALSO TO DISTRIBUTE RESPONSIBILITIES, EACH MPI WILL HAVE PRIMARY OVERSIGHT OF ONE OF THE CENTER COMPONENTS (I.E., ADMINISTRATIVE CORE, RESEARCH PROGRAM, IMPLEMENTATION LAB), ALTHOUGH EACH MPI WILL BE CRITICALLY INVOLVED IN ALL CENTER COMPONENTS. GIVEN HER EXPERTISE IN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE AND ROLE AS DIRECTOR OF PISCE@LDI, DR. BEIDAS WILL OVERSEE THE RESEARCH PROGRAM. GIVEN HIS ROLE AS DIRECTOR OF PC3I AND EXPERTISE AS A PRACTICING RADIATION ONCOLOGIST, DR. BEKELMAN WILL OVERSEE THE IMPLEMENTATION LAB. GIVEN HIS ROLE IN THE ACC AS ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF POPULATION SCIENCE, DR. SCHNOLL WILL OVERSEE THE ADMINISTRATIVE CORE. ALL MPIS WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH DR. SHULMAN (IMPLEMENTATION LAB), DR. BUTTENHEIM (RESEARCH PROGRAM), AND LEADERS OF THE SIGNATURE PILOT PROJECTS TO ENSURE THAT THE GOALS OF THE CENTER ARE ACHIEVED. DRS. BEIDAS, BEKELMAN, AND SCHNOLL WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING FINAL DECISIONS, COORDINATING ACTIVITIES, AND WRITING PROGRESS REPORTS. COMMUNICATION PLANS. THE MPIS WILL COMMUNICATE AT LEAST WEEKLY IN PERSON TO DISCUSS ISSUES RELATED TO CENTER ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING SCIENTIFIC AND OPERATIONAL MATTERS. DRS. BEIDAS AND SCHNOLL HAVE OFFICES IN THE SAME BUILDING AND MEET REGULARLY (MORE THAN ONCE WEEKLY) ABOUT ONGOING PROJECTS, WHICH WILL FACILITATE COMMUNICATION. DR. BEKELMAN IS LOCATED AT THE PERELMAN CENTER FOR ADVANCED MEDICINE (IN THE SAME BUILDING AS DR. SHULMAN), WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE HOSPITAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA AND IS WITHIN A SEVEN-MINUTE WALK AND REGULARLY HOSTS MEETINGS THAT DRS. BEIDAS AND SCHNOLL ATTEND. FURTHER, THE DIRECTOR OF THE ACC, DR. ROBERT VONDERHEIDE, HAS GENEROUSLY OFFERED TO PROVIDE SPACE IN THE ACC FOR THIS PROJECT TO ALLOW FOR SHARED WORK SPACE AND TO FACILITATE LEADERSHIP INTEGRATION AND CROSS-PROJECT INTERACTIONS. DRS. BEIDAS, BEKELMAN, AND SCHNOLL MEET AT LEAST TWICE-WEEKLY AT PRESENT, SO THESE LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION WILL BE EASILY ACHIEVED. ALL MPIS WILL PROVIDE JOINT SCIENTIFIC DIRECTION TO THE PROJECT, CALLING UPON THE SUBSTANTIAL EXPERTISE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLED PROJECT TEAM (SEE RESEARCH PROGRAM AND BIOSKETCHES FOR FURTHER DETAILS).

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS, FOR EXAMPLE, REGARDING ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF STUDY DESIGN, HAVE BEEN EASILY RESOLVED THROUGH DIRECT COMMUNICATION AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE THAT AS OUR MAIN APPROACH. SHOULD THE NEED ARISE, THE MPIS WILL ELICIT THE ADVICE OF DR. JON EPSTEIN, WILLIAM WIKOFF SMITH PROFESSOR OF CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH AND EXECUTIVE VICE DEAN OF THE PERELMAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THE NEED FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION, HOWEVER, DUE TO THE UPFRONT, CLEAR DELINEATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AMONG THE MPIS AND THEIR LONGSTANDING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP.

 OVER THE PAST DECADE, NAMIBIA HAS MADE IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS. THE RECENT NAMPHIA STUDY SHOWS THAT OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLHIV) AGED 15-64 YEARS, 86% REPORTED KNOWING THEIR HIV STATUS, AND ONCE DIAGNOSED OVER 90% OF PLHIV WERE LINKED TO ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) AND VIRALLY SUPPRESSED. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF NAMIBIA (GRN) HAS TAKEN DECISIVE STEPS TO SCALE UP BEST PRACTICES, INCLUDING INTEGRATING PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP) INTO THE NATIONAL ART GUIDELINES, INCREASING HIV TESTING ACCESS AND YIELD THROUGH TARGETED INDEX PARTNER TESTING AND HIV SELF-TESTING AND INTRODUCING COMMUNITY-BASED ART MODELS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED HIGH RETENTION RATES.

WHILE LITTLE DATA ON TG MEN OR WOMEN ARE AVAILABLE, THE PLACE STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES (MOHSS) IN WINDHOEK FOUND THAT TG WOMEN REPORTED THE LOWEST RATES OF HIV TESTING AT 12%, COMPARED TO 30% AND 57% FOR FEMALE SWS (FSWS) AND MSM, RESPECTIVELY. TREATMENT COVERAGE FOR KEY POPULATIONS (KPS) WAS LOW (33.7% OF HIV-INFECTED FSWS AND 15% OF HIV-INFECTED MSM) WITH SIGNIFICANT LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP ALONG THE CONTINUUM OF HIV PREVENTION, CARE AND TREATMENT, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE RISK OF HIV TRANSMISSION OR REINFECTION OF HIV POSITIVE SEX PARTNERS. 
 
 RECENT DATA FROM IBBS STUDY DONE IN 2019 AT THREE SELECTED SITES OF KATIMA MULILO, WINDHOEK, WALVIS BAY & SWAKOPMUND HAS SHOWN THAT HIV PREVALENCE AMONG YOUNG FSW AGED 18-24 YEARS, A PROXY FOR HIV INCIDENCE, HAS REMAINED HIGH AND RANGES FROM 4.8% TO 27.4%. THERE IS A HIGH SYPHILIS PREVALENCE 8.9% AMONG FSW AND 30% OF KPS REPORTED NEVER USING A CONDOM, BOTH DATA POINTS INDICATING LOW UPTAKE OF PREVENTION INITIATIVES AND PERCEIVED RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION BY KP COMMUNITY. THE IBBS 2019 STUDY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE HIV VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION AMONG KPS REMAINS AT ALL STUDY SITES WITH 77.2%, 69.4% AND 28.3% AT WINDHOEK, KATIMA MULILO AND WALVIS BAY/SWAKOPMUND RESPECTIVELY. 
 
 THE KEY CHALLENGES FACING KPS INCLUDE HIGH RATES OF STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION (S&D) AND VIOLENCE AGAINST KPS; WEAK BIDIRECTIONAL LINKAGES/REFERRAL MECHANISMS BETWEEN COMMUNITY AND HEALTH FACILITY-BASED SERVICES; LACK OF KPSÃ‚   KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIV AND THEIR RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION AND HOW TO ACCESS SERVICES AND SUPPORT; AND A LACK OF HOLISTIC RESILIENCY AND RISK REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS. ACHIEVING AND SUSTAINING EPIDEMIC CONTROL IN NAMIBIA WILL REQUIRE A RAPID ACCELERATION OF THE HIV RESPONSE FOR KPS, USING COORDINATED, DATA-DRIVEN APPROACHES AT SCALE TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE MAJOR BIOMEDICAL, STRUCTURAL, AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS THAT INCREASE KPSÃ‚   VULNERABILITY TO HIV, ALONGSIDE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT OF KP-LED AND KP-SERVING ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO REACH THESE MOST HARD-TO-REACH POPULATIONS.
 
 UNDER KP-STAR, KPS WILL BENEFIT FROM SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF INTERVENTIONS SO THAT HIV TRANSMISSION IS REDUCED, AND PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV OBTAIN EARLY ACCESS TO SERVICES. OUR IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK PRIORITIZES KEY AREAS ALONG THE CASCADE THAT REQUIRE CONCENTRATED ATTENTION, INCLUDING TARGETED, HIGH-YIELD HTS APPROACHES; EARLY/SAME-DAY INITIATION ON ART; AND THE EXPANSION OF DIFFERENTIATED SERVICE DELIVERY (DSD) MODELS FOR KPS.

 PROJECT TITLE: NSF CONVERGENCE ACCELERATOR TRACK K: COMPASS: COMPREHENSIVE PREDICTION,
 ASSESSMENT, AND EQUITABLE SOLUTIONS FOR STORM-INDUCED CONTAMINATION OF FRESHWATER SYSTEMS
 JSU TEAM: THE JSU TEAM IS COMPRISED OF DR. SADIK KHAN, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL
 ENGINEERING AND DR. SHARON SIMMON, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. BOTH OF THE TEAM MEMBERS
 WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE USC TEAM TO ACHIEVE THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES.
 PROJECT OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED CONVERGENCE ACCELERATOR IS TO DEVELOP A SOCIAL-TECHNICAL
 FRAGILITY FRAMEWORK TO ENABLE COMMUNITIES WITH TOOLS TO DESIGN NEXT-GENERATION HARD AND SOFT INFRASTRUCTURE
 THAT IS ADAPTIVE, ACTIVE, SUSTAINABLE, AND DRIVEN BY CO-GENERATED KNOWLEDGE AND POLICY. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED
 THROUGH INVESTIGATING FLOODWATER AND CONTAMINANT MOVEMENT IN THE COMMUNITYÃ‚  S WATER SOURCES AS PART OF
 A HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT CONSIDERS THE COMMUNITYÃ‚  S SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS.
 MAJOR RESEARCH OBJECTIVES INCLUDE:
 OBJECTIVE 1: STUDY AUTONOMOUS SENSING SYSTEMS: DEVELOP A MODULAR PLATFORM FOR INTELLIGENT FLOOD AND
 CONTAMINANT MONITORING WITH HETEROGENEOUS DATA ACQUISITION, AND REAL-TIME DATA AND MODEL ASSIMILATION.
 OBJECTIVE 2: INVESTIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL-SOCIAL-TECHNICAL FRAGILITY FRAMEWORK: DEVELOP A UNIFIED FRAGILITY
 FRAMEWORK TO QUANTIFY THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF STRESSORS.
 OBJECTIVE 3: STUDY ADAPTATION FOR A RESILIENT COMMUNITY: INVESTIGATE ADAPTATION SOLUTIONS FOR RESILIENCE
 THAT CONSIDER THE HUMAN FACTOR, COMMUNITY-BASED SYSTEMS, AND ENTREPRENEURIAL TRANSFORMATION OF RESEARCH.
 STUDY AREA: THE JSU TEAM WILL BE INVOLVED IN COLLECTING THE WATER SAMPLES FROM THE PERAL RIVER WATERSHED
 IN JACKSON, MS, WHICH OFFER STRONG POTENTIAL FOR CONVERGENCE RESEARCH ON STORM-INDUCED CONTAMINANTS. THE
 PEARL RIVER WATERSHED ENCOMPASS HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS BUT ALSO CONFRONT DIVERSE CHALLENGES
 ARISING FROM COMPOUND FLOODING, RAPID URBANIZATION, AND EQUITY CONCERNS. FOR INSTANCE, JACKSONÃ‚  S ISSUES
 WITH SEWAGE SPILLS AND PIPE LEAKS HAVE BEEN WELL-DOCUMENTED.
 INDIVIDUAL TASKS OF JSU TEAM: DR. SADIK KHAN WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERALL PROJECT PLANNING,
 COORDINATION, TRAINING, AND SUPERVISION OF THE UNDERGRAD STUDENTS AND OVERALL MANAGEMENT OF THE WORKS
 RELATED TO MONITORING WATER QUALITY AND TESTING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE DEVELOPED SENSORS. DR. SADIK KHAN WILL
 WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE USC TEAM IN TERMS OF SAMPLE COLLECTION, PROJECT SITE LOCATION, COLLABORATION
 WITH EXTERNAL AGENCIES SUCH AS PEARL RIVER AUTHORITY, HIRING AND TRAINING THE STUDENTS FOR THE PROJECT
 ACTIVITIES, NMR SENSOR DEVELOPMENT, EVALUATION AND TESTING.
 DR. SHARON SIMMONS WILL LEAD THE ENTREPRENEURIAL TRANSFORMATION FOR THIS PROJECT. TO ACHIEVE THE FULL
 BENEFITS THAT THE PROPOSED SYSTEM CAN PROVIDE, A STRUCTURED COMMUNICATION STRATEGY THAT INCORPORATES
 SUPPORT, TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND CONSULTING TO POTENTIAL ENTREPRENEURS AND ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES IN THE
 JURISDICTIONS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. THIS APPROACH PURSUES THE GOAL OF THE RESILIENCE OF THE PLANNING PROCESS
 ITSELF BY FOSTERING SOCIAL INTERACTION BETWEEN MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS INTERESTED IN THE DYNAMIC CO-CREATION OF
 RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. IN THIS ACCORD, THE DATA COLLECTED FROM THIS PROJECT WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE IN
 CONVENIENT, MODIFIABLE, AND OPEN FORMATS THAT CAN BE RETRIEVED, INDEXED, AND USED BY A VARIETY OF USERS FOR
 THE WIDEST RANGE OF PURPOSES, INCLUDING SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS, POLICY INITIATIVES, AND NEW VENTURE CREATION.
 TO FACILITATE DATA ACCESSIBILITY, THE OPEN DATA WILL BE DESCRIBED AT ENTREPRENEURSHIP CONFERENCES AND TO

AS A PRECURSOR TO CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL), MBL IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE PRESENCE OF MONOCLONAL B-CELL CLONES IN THE PERIPHERAL BLOOD OF OTHERWISE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. EARLY EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THAT MBL INCREASES RISK OF ADVERSE CLINICAL OUTCOMES, INCLUDING PROGRESSION TO CLL REQUIRING THERAPY, DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER HEMATOLOGICAL AND SOLID CANCERS, HOSPITALIZATIONS DUE TO SERIOUS INFECTIONS, AND REDUCED HUMORAL IMMUNE RESPONSE TO VACCINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE SCALE AND DIVERSITY OF MBL STUDIES IS CURRENTLY LIMITED BY THE NEED FOR FLOW CYTOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS TO DIAGNOSE MBL. THESE BIOSPECIMENS ARE RARELY AVAILABLE IN LARGE BIOBANKING OR COHORT STUDIES THAT COULD OTHERWISE ALLOW MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND WELL-POWERED INVESTIGATION OF THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF MBL, ESPECIALLY IN POPULATIONS OF DIVERSE ANCESTRIES. WE PROPOSE TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS BY DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING A STRATEGY TO PREDICT MBL STATUS (AIM 1). IN BRIEF, WE PROPOSE USING EXISTING GENOTYPING ARRAY DATA, THAT IS READILY AVAILABLE IN MANY BIOBANKS, TO IDENTIFY MOSAIC CHROMOSOMAL ALTERATIONS (MCAS), WHICH AFFECT LARGE SEGMENTS OF DNA AND INCLUDE GAINS, LOSSES, AND COPY NUMBER-NEUTRAL LOSS OF HETEROZYGOSITY EVENTS. RECENT WORK IN BIOBANK STUDIES HAS ESTABLISHED MCAS AS A POTENT RISK FACTOR FOR LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES BUT MBL IS ALSO A MAJOR RISK FACTOR OF LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES, AND THUS THE QUESTION OF HOW MCAS RELATE TO MBL IS UNKNOWN. WE HAVE COLLECTED THE LARGEST COHORT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH MBL AND GENETIC DATA, AND IN OUR PRELIMINARY ANALYSES, WE FOUND THAT AUTOSOMAL MCAS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH RISK OF MBL WITH AN ODDS RATIO OF 50.5 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 36.5-70.6, P = 1.34X10-152) WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION. AIM 1 WILL VALIDATE THESE RESULTS, DEVELOP A PREDICTIVE MODEL WITH OTHER KNOWN RISK FACTORS FOR MBL, AND THEN EXAMINE GENERALIZABILITY OF THE MODEL TO INDIVIDUALS WITH STRONG FAMILY HISTORY OF LYMPHOID MALIGNANCY AND TO INDIVIDUALS OF AFRICAN ANCESTRY. WE FURTHER HYPOTHESIZE THAT MCAS ARE DRIVERS OF B-CELL CLONE GROWTH. IN AIM 2 WE WILL BE THE FIRST TO QUANTIFY THE INCIDENCE OF MCAS AND THE CHANGE IN CELL FRACTION OF MCAS OVER TIME FROM SERIAL PERIPHERAL BLOOD SAMPLES THAT HAVE ALSO BEEN SCREENED FOR MBL. WE WILL THEN EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MCAS AND GROWTH TRAJECTORIES OF B-CELL CLONES IN INDIVIDUALS WITH MBL. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THESE AIMS WILL UNLOCK THE ABILITY TO STUDY MBL IN THE LARGEST COHORTS IN THE WORLD, ENABLING FUTURE STUDIES OF MBL AT AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE. AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF MBL, RISK STRATIFICATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH MBL WILL BE ESSENTIAL. THIS PROPOSAL WILL ALSO BEGIN TO ENABLE SUCH STRATIFICATION BY CHARACTERIZING MBL CLONAL TRAJECTORIES. TOGETHER, THESE AIMS WILL CATALYZE FUTURE STUDIES OF MBL TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF TO INFORM ETIOLOGIC FACTORS AND RISK STRATIFICATION OF THIS PREVALENT PRECANCER FOR EVENTUAL CANCER CONTROL.",assistance_sub,8/5/2024,8/5/2024,0,Single Action,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,Small ($10K - $100K),0,2
026461H,NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY,Department of Agriculture (USDA),"$49,485.00 ",2/13/2024,"APPROXIMATELY 85 TO 90% OF THE 1.6 M ACRES OF SUNFLOWER IN THE U.S. ARE PLANTED IN THE NORTH CENTRAL STATES. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL SUNFLOWER ASSOCIATION (NSA), DISEASES ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BIOLOGICAL YIELD-LIMITING FACTOR FOR SUNFLOWER PRODUCTION, YET FEW PATHOLOGISTS WORK ON SUNFLOWER AND UNTIL RECENTLY, LIMITED EXTENSION MATERIALS ON SUNFLOWER DISEASES WERE AVAILABLE. AS A CONSEQUENCE, DISEASE IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT CONSISTENTLY HAVE BEEN VERY CHALLENGING AND SOME GROWERS RESORT TO A 'SPRAY AND PRAY' APPROACH TO DISEASE MANAGEMENT. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, THE SUNFLOWER PATHOLOGY WORKING GROUP (SPWG) WAS FORMED WITH SUPPORT FROM THE NORTH CENTRAL IPM CENTER. THE MISSION OF THE SPWG IS TO DEVELOP EXTENSION MATERIALS, PROGRAMS AND EVENTS IN MULTIPLE SUNFLOWER PRODUCTION REGIONS THAT WILL HELP GROWERS AND STAKEHOLDERS IDENTIFY DISEASES AND OTHER PESTS AS WELL AS FACILITATE THEIR ABILITY TO USE IPM. FOR FY2023, WE DESIGNED THREE OBJECTIVES, (1) MAXIMIZE SKILLS, COLLABORATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS TO IMPROVE SUNFLOWER DISEASE IDENTIFICATION, MANAGEMENT AND IPM, (2) FACILITATE AN INCREASE IN SPEED AND ACCURACY OF SUNFLOWER DISEASE IDENTIFICATION BY PLANT DIAGNOSTICIANS AND PRACTITIONERS, AND (3) INCREASE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN ACTIVITIES ORGANIZED BY SPWG THAT DEMONSTRATES ADVANCES IN SUNFLOWER DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND IPM TO GROWERS. FOR OBJECTIVE 1, WE WILL CONTINUE TO OPTIMIZE THE COMMUNICATION EFFORTS AND IMPACT OF SPWG. THIS WILL INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL AND TEAM ASSESSMENTS FROM THE VIA INSTITUTE ON CHARACTER FOR EACH OF THE SEVEN MEMBERS (ALSO AS PART OF OUR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSIVITY, AND ACCESSIBILITY PLAN). FOR OBJECTIVE 2, WE PLAN TO COMPLETE ONE APS PLANT HEALTH PROGRESS DIAGNOSTIC GUIDE TENTATIVELY TITLED ""SUNFLOWER HEAD ROTS - RHIZOPUS, SCLEROTINIA AND MINOR DISEASES"" TO PROVIDE THE PLANT DISEASE DIAGNOSTICIANS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS WITH TOOLS TO DIAGNOSE SUNFLOWER HEAD DISEASES. ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL PUBLISH ONE PRESS ARTICLE IN THE NSA'S THE SUNFLOWER MAGAZINE, TENTATIVELY TITLED 'UNDERSTANDING HEAD ROTS' FOR GROWERS. FOR OBJECTIVE 3, WITH POTENTIAL FUNDING (SUBMISSION OF A CARE PROPOSAL) FROM THE NSA AND USDA-AFRI, WE PLAN TO INCREASE FARMER AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IN EXTENSION ACTIVITIES SUCH AS COORDINATED DEMONSTRATION PLOTS AND EVENTS IN NEBRASKA, NORTH DAKOTA, AND SOUTH DAKOTA. THE ANTICIPATED OVERALL OUTCOME OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT GROWERS LEARN UP-TO-DATE DISEASE DIAGNOSIS, IDENTIFY EMERGING PESTS AND PEST RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT, SO THAT THEIR IPM KNOWLEDGE INCREASES, AND THEIR IPM MANAGEMENT IS MORE EFFECTIVE, EFFICIENT AND SUSTAINABLE. TO ACCOMPLISH ALL THE PROPOSED OBJECTIVES, WE ANTICIPATE PARTNERING WITH PLANT HEALTH PRACTITIONERS (INCLUDING THOSE FROM THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES) AND THE NSA. ULTIMATELY, WE BELIEVE OUR IMPACT WILL BE TO ELIMINATE THE 'SPRAY AND PRAY' APPROACH TO SUNFLOWER DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND REPLACE IT WITH AN IPM APPROACH. THIS PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS PRIORITIES WITHIN NCIPMC SIGNATURE PROGRAMS; TO SUPPORT AND PROMOTE IPM PRACTICES THAT WILL IMPROVE CROP SYSTEM SUSTAINABILITY BY INCREASING FARM PROFITABILITY AND REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS USING IPM PRACTICES, AS WELL AS DEVELOPING SYSTEMS THAT CAN RAPIDLY IDENTIFY NEW RE-EMERGING OR RESISTANT PESTS AND MINIMIZE THEIR IMPACT.

 OVER THE PAST DECADE, NAMIBIA HAS MADE IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS. THE RECENT NAMPHIA STUDY SHOWS THAT OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLHIV) AGED 15-64 YEARS, 86% REPORTED KNOWING THEIR HIV STATUS, AND ONCE DIAGNOSED OVER 90% OF PLHIV WERE LINKED TO ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) AND VIRALLY SUPPRESSED. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF NAMIBIA (GRN) HAS TAKEN DECISIVE STEPS TO SCALE UP BEST PRACTICES, INCLUDING INTEGRATING PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP) INTO THE NATIONAL ART GUIDELINES, INCREASING HIV TESTING ACCESS AND YIELD THROUGH TARGETED INDEX PARTNER TESTING AND HIV SELF-TESTING AND INTRODUCING COMMUNITY-BASED ART MODELS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED HIGH RETENTION RATES.
 
 DESPITE THIS PROGRESS, KEY AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONSÃ‚  PARTICULARLY SEX WORKERS (SWS), MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN (MSM), AND TRANSGENDER (TG) WOMENÃ‚  CONTINUE TO BE LEFT BEHIND. OVERALL HIV PREVALENCE AMONG ADULTS 15-49 STANDS AT 11.8% BUT RISES TO 53.2% AMONG SWS IN KATIMA MULILO AND KEETMANSHOOP AND 20.9% AMONG MSM IN WINDHOEK. WHILE LITTLE DATA ON TG MEN OR WOMEN ARE AVAILABLE, THE PLACE STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES (MOHSS) IN WINDHOEK FOUND THAT TG WOMEN REPORTED THE LOWEST RATES OF HIV TESTING AT 12%, COMPARED TO 30% AND 57% FOR FEMALE SWS (FSWS) AND MSM, RESPECTIVELY. TREATMENT COVERAGE FOR KEY POPULATIONS (KPS) WAS LOW (33.7% OF HIV-INFECTED FSWS AND 15% OF HIV-INFECTED MSM) WITH SIGNIFICANT LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP ALONG THE CONTINUUM OF HIV PREVENTION, CARE AND TREATMENT, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE RISK OF HIV TRANSMISSION OR REINFECTION OF HIV POSITIVE SEX PARTNERS. 
 
 RECENT DATA FROM IBBS STUDY DONE IN 2019 AT THREE SELECTED SITES OF KATIMA MULILO, WINDHOEK, WALVIS BAY & SWAKOPMUND HAS SHOWN THAT HIV PREVALENCE AMONG YOUNG FSW AGED 18-24 YEARS, A PROXY FOR HIV INCIDENCE, HAS REMAINED HIGH AND RANGES FROM 4.8% TO 27.4%. THERE IS A HIGH SYPHILIS PREVALENCE 8.9% AMONG FSW AND 30% OF KPS REPORTED NEVER USING A CONDOM, BOTH DATA POINTS INDICATING LOW UPTAKE OF PREVENTION INITIATIVES AND PERCEIVED RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION BY KP COMMUNITY. THE IBBS 2019 STUDY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE HIV VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION AMONG KPS REMAINS AT ALL STUDY SITES WITH 77.2%, 69.4% AND 28.3% AT WINDHOEK, KATIMA MULILO AND WALVIS BAY/SWAKOPMUND RESPECTIVELY. 
 
 THE KEY CHALLENGES FACING KPS INCLUDE HIGH RATES OF STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION (S&D) AND VIOLENCE AGAINST KPS; WEAK BIDIRECTIONAL LINKAGES/REFERRAL MECHANISMS BETWEEN COMMUNITY AND HEALTH FACILITY-BASED SERVICES; LACK OF KPSÃ‚   KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIV AND THEIR RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION AND HOW TO ACCESS SERVICES AND SUPPORT; AND A LACK OF HOLISTIC RESILIENCY AND RISK REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS. ACHIEVING AND SUSTAINING EPIDEMIC CONTROL IN NAMIBIA WILL REQUIRE A RAPID ACCELERATION OF THE HIV RESPONSE FOR KPS, USING COORDINATED, DATA-DRIVEN APPROACHES AT SCALE TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE MAJOR BIOMEDICAL, STRUCTURAL, AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS THAT INCREASE KPSÃ‚   VULNERABILITY TO HIV, ALONGSIDE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT OF KP-LED AND KP-SERVING ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO REACH THESE MOST HARD-TO-REACH POPULATIONS.
 
 UNDER KP-STAR, KPS WILL BENEFIT FROM SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF INTERVENTIONS SO THAT HIV TRANSMISSION IS REDUCED, AND PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV OBTAIN EARLY ACCESS TO SERVICES. OUR IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK PRIORITIZES KEY AREAS ALONG THE CASCADE THAT REQUIRE CONCENTRATED ATTENTION, INCLUDING TARGETED, HIGH-YIELD HTS APPROACHES; EARLY/SAME-DAY INITIATION ON ART; AND THE EXPANSION OF DIFFERENTIATED SERVICE DELIVERY (DSD) MODELS FOR KPS.

 THE HORTICULTURAL SECTOR IN KENYA IS HERALDED AS ONE OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAÃ‚  S PRINCIPAL SUCCESS STORIES. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT EARNINGS FROM HORTICULTURAL EXPORTS, 72% OF EXPORT EARNINGS ARE DERIVED FROM FLOWERS. KENYA EXPORTS ONLY ABOUT 5% OF TOTAL PRODUCTION OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES (FFVS) WITH 95% OF TOTAL PRODUCTION UTILIZED WITHIN THE DOMESTIC MARKET. HORTICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS CAN EITHER BE LONG OR SHORT DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS INVOLVED. HOWEVER, THESE VALUE CHAINS IN GENERAL HAVE POTENTIAL TO EMPOWER WOMEN AND YOUTH TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS IN TERMS OF NUTRITION, HEALTH AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS. COMMERCIALIZATION AND FORMALIZATION OF FFV VALUE CHAINS MAY INADVERTENTLY DISEMPOWER WOMEN BUT FEEDBACK EFFECTS ARE CURRENTLY NOT CLEAR. EVEN THOUGH KENYA HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF ICT INNOVATIONS, THERE IS LIMITED KNOWLEDGE ON THE IMPACT OF THE ICT ALONG HORTICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADVENT OF PANDEMICS SUCH AS THE COVID-19.

 THE NATIONAL EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY PLAN (2017) HIGHLIGHTS TECHNOLOGY AS A POWERFUL TOOL
 FOR TRANSFORMING LEARNING TO ADVANCE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS, REINVENT
 APPROACHES TO LEARNING AND COLLABORATION, SHRINK EQUITY AND ACCESSIBILITY GAPS, AND ADAPT
 INDIVIDUAL LEARNING NEEDS (U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, 2016). TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED TO
 TEACH ACADEMIC SKILLS ACROSS CONTENT AREAS BUT ALSO HAS A ROLE IN TEACHING SOCIAL SKILLS,
 COMMUNICATION SKILLS, AND ADAPTIVE BEHAVIORS. THESE DOMAINS ALL REPRESENT CORE DEFICITS
 ASSOCIATED WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD).
 THE INCREASED USE OF TECHNOLOGY-BASED INTERVENTIONS REFLECTS THE INCREASING ROLE OF
 TECHNOLOGY IN THE LIVES OF STUDENTS BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES. THE FAST-PACED GROWTH OF
 THE EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY MARKET SHOWS NO SIGNS OF DECELERATION AND HAS HELPED DEVELOP A
 MARKETPLACE BUSTING WITH NEW DEVICES, APPS, AND PROGRAMS MOST WITHOUT EMPIRICAL SUPPORT
 DEMONSTRATING EFFICACIOUS OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS, PARENTS, OR EDUCATORS. THUS, MAKING MEANINGFUL

 THERE IS INTENSIVE FREIGHT MOVEMENT THROUGH THE REGION 6 STATES FERRYING GOODS TO THE CITIES AND RURAL
 COMMUNITIES THEREIN. WHILE MUCH ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE COASTAL PORTS, THERE IS INADEQUATE ATTENTION
 TO INLAND PORTS. INLAND PORTS MAY BE RIVER BASED AS IN THE LARGEST INLAND INTERNATIONAL SEAPORT IN THE
 UNITED STATES, PORT OF CATOOSA IN TULSA. OKLAHOMA. THIS PORT SHIPS MORE THAN 2 MILLION TONS OF CARGO
 ANNUALLY ON BARGES ON THE MCCLELLAN-KERR ARKANSAS RIVER NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.
 ARKANSAS, ALSO, HAS SEVERAL INLAND PORTS. BEYOND THE WATERWAYS, INLAND PORTS ALSO PROVIDE INTERMODAL
 TRANSITION FOR RAILROADS AND TRUCKING OPERATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, THE INLAND PORT OF DALLAS FOCUSES ON
 RAILROAD AND TRUCKING CONNECTIONS. NEW MEXICO'S INLAND PORTS AND SOME IN TEXAS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH
 INTERNATIONAL BORDERS. THE LOCATIONS OF THESE PORTS ARE SOMETIMES PROXIMATE TO COMMUNITIES AND
 NEIGHBORHOODS THAT BEAR A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH INLAND PORTS.
 PROXIMITY MAY INCREASE NOISE LEVELS, TRAFFIC AND MOBILITY, AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY INFLUENCING PROPERTY
 VALUES. ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, NUMEROUS JOB OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE JOB BASE.
 QUESTIONS OF EQUITY AND VULNERABILITY ARE SUITABLE FOR RESEARCH. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH WILL BE TO
 IDENTIFY TO RELEVANT VARIABLES FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES PROXIMATE TO INLAND PORTS, TO ITERATE POSITIVE
 VARIABLES AND DELINEATE MITIGATION STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES.
 RESEARCH IDEA 2
 THE POPULARITY OF BICYCLES AS A FORM OF TRANSPORTATION IS GROWING AROUND THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY IN
 URBAN AREAS. MANY RESEARCH WORKS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF BICYCLES IN REDUCING TRAFFIC
 CONGESTION AND IMPROVING AIR CONDITION. ROADWAY CONSTRUCTION SHOULD MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL ROAD
 USERS, INCLUDING CYCLISTS. HOWEVER, MANY EXISTING ROADWAYS DID NOT PLAN BICYCLE FACILITIES WHEN
 INITIALLY DESIGNED. WITH THE INCREASED NUMBER OF CYCLISTS, ADDING DESIGNATED BIKE LANES IS NECESSARY.
 WHEN PHYSICALLY WIDENING THE ROADWAY IS NOT FEASIBLE, THE COMMON METHODS TO ADD BIKE LANES ARE
 UTILIZING SHOULDERS, CURBS, REDUCING THE WIDTH OF EXISTING TRAVEL LANES OR PARKING LANES, OR REDUCING
 THE NUMBER OF TRAVEL LANES OR PARKING LANES.
 MANY CITIES HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED CONSTRUCTIONS TO ADDED BIKE LANES. HOWEVER, THE SAFETY
 IMPACTS OF ADDING BIKE LANES HAVEN'T BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED. ACCORDING TO THE
 CLEARINGHOUSE, CRASH MODIFICATION FACTORS DEVELOPED FOR INSTALLING BICYCLE LANES WERE MIXED
 RESULTS, AND MOST OF THEM WERE DEVELOPED BASED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF SAMPLES. THEREFORE, MORE
 STUDIES ARE NEEDED.
 IN HOUSTON, NEARLY 1,800 MILES OF HIGH-COMFORT BIKEWAYS WERE PLANNED IN 2020. MANY CONSTRUCTIONS
 HAVE BEEN COMPLETED IN 2021 OR MORE RECENTLY, WHICH PROVIDES US RESOURCES TO PERFORM SAFETY
 ANALYSIS ON THE NEWLY ADDED BIKE LANES. THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO ANALYZE THE
 SAFETY IMPACTS OF DIFFERENT METHODS OF ADDING BIKE LANES BY CONDUCTING CASE STUDIES AT SELECTED SITES
 IN HOUSTON, TEXAS.
 NOTE THAT, TO ADD BIKE LANES, THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SOME ROADWAYS WILL NOT ONLY ACCOMMODATE
 CYCLISTS BUT ALSO WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND THE OPERATION OF THE WHOLE
 ROADWAY NETWORK. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH COULD PROVIDE A REFERENCE FOR CITIES IN REGION 6 WHEN
 PLANNING TO ADD BIKE LANES.

OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVE IS TO GENERATE NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE MECHANISMS LINKING DISCRIMINATION EXPOSURE TO DISPROPORTIONATE TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2D) RISK IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS IN THE US. INVESTIGATORS AT THE ARNOLD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, AND LEADERS OF THE COUNCIL ON BLACK HEALTH WILL BLEND THEIR COMPLEMENTARY EXPERTISE TO ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS IN AN EXISTING LONGITUDINAL DATASET, THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT STUDY (ABCD) - A LARGE AND RACIALLY DIVERSE POPULATION-BASED COHORT WITH AN EXTENSIVE ARRAY OF PSYCHOSOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES AND BIOMARKERS:
 
  AIM 1: ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AND T2D RISK IN THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (ABCD) COHORT.
 TO ACCOMPLISH THIS AIM, WE WILL ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION (NEIGHBORHOOD AND INTERPERSONAL) AND TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK [A) CHILDÃ‚  S MEAN HBA1C LEVEL AND B) BINARY INDICATOR OF T2D DIAGNOSIS IF HBA1C Ã‚ Â¥ 6.5% (8 MMOL/MOL).] HYPOTHESIS 1.A: INCREASED DISCRIMINATION IS LINKED TO HIGHER MEAN HBA1C LEVELS AND ELEVATED ODDS OF T2D DIAGNOSIS.
 
 AIM 2: EXTENT TO WHICH MULTIPLE FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION ACCOUNT FOR RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN T2D RISK IN THE ABCD COHORT. 
 TO ACCOMPLISH THIS AIM, WE WILL USE OAXACA BLINDER DECOMPOSITION TO EXAMINE THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH FORM OF DISCRIMINATION EXPOSURE IN EXPLAINING DISPARITIES IN T2D RISK BETWEEN RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUPS. HYPOTHESIS 2: DIFFERENTIAL EXPOSURE TO DISCRIMINATION EXPLAINS A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN T2D RISK.
 
  AIM 3: INVESTIGATE MEDIATING HEALTH BEHAVIORS IN THE ABCD COHORT.
 IN THIS AIM, WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER HEALTH BEHAVIORS (I.E., DIET QUALITY, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND SCREEN TIME UTILIZATION) MEDIATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISCRIMINATION AND T2D RISK. HYPOTHESIS 3: HEALTH BEHAVIORS AT WILL MEDIATE THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN DISCRIMINATION EXPOSURE AND T2D RISK.

 PARTNERSHIPS IN SCHOOL MEAL IMPLEMENTATION
 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE: DISPARITIES IN CHILDHOOD OBESITY HAVE INCREASED SINCE THE COVID-19
 PANDEMIC, ESPECIALLY FOR ADOLESCENTS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX, COMMUNITY AND POPULATION-LEVEL FACTORS
 THAT INFLUENCE HEALTH OUTCOMES (I.E., POVERTY, DISCRIMINATION, INADEQUATE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD),
 POLICY, SYSTEMS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL APPROACHES ARE NECESSARY TO MITIGATE OBESITY RISK AND ACHIEVE
 EQUITABLE OUTCOMES FOR MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS SUCH AS AND RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES AND THOSE WITH
 LOW-INCOME. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT PROVIDING HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER QUALITY
 NUTRITIONAL INTAKE AND REDUCED OBESITY PREVALENCE, ESPECIALLY IN LOW-INCOME STUDENTS. THUS, INCREASING
 ACCESS TO HEALTHY MEALS AT SCHOOL IS A CRITICAL STEP TO MITIGATING DISPARITIES IN OBESITY PREVALENCE IN
 YOUTH. UNIVERSAL FREE SCHOOL MEALS (USM) ADOPTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH QUALITY OF DIETARY INTAKE, FOOD
 SECURITY, AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OUTCOMES OBSERVED THROUGH RANDOMIZED TRIALS AND LONGITUDINAL
 STUDIES. THEREFORE, USM IS A KEY PSE APPROACH FOR EQUITABLE OBESITY PREVENTION. HOWEVER, UPTAKE OF
 SCHOOL MEALS IS LOW DESPITE BEING PROVIDED AT NO COST; TO DATE THERE IS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHY
 AND HOW THIS IS THE CASE, FURTHER CONTRIBUTING THIS IMPLEMENTATION GAP.
 A KEY ISSUE WHICH NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IS A LACK OF REPRESENTATION FROM END-USERS AND IMPLEMENTERS
 WHO HAVE VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE, SUCH AS STUDENTS, CAREGIVERS, TEACHERS, LEADERSHIP, AND
 COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCE IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED BY RESEARCHERS, WHICH MAY CAUSE
 MISTRUST IN THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND DISENFRANCHISEMENT. MOST EVALUATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED
 TO UNDERSTAND PERSPECTIVES OF THOSE WHO ENGAGE WITH CABS, BUT NOT THE MEMBERS THEMSELVES. THUS,
 THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE:
 1) TO EVALUATE THE ACCEPTABILITY, APPROPRIATENESS, AND FEASIBILITY OF RECRUITING A CAB WHICH REFLECTS
 THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OF PHILADELPHIA (SDP) AND
 SURROUNDING COMMUNITY; AND
 2) TO ASSESS DETERMINANTS OF THESE OUTCOMES THROUGH A HEALTH EQUITY LENS USING MIXED METHODS
 METHODS: THE CAB WILL BE RECRUITED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2023; WE AIM TO RECRUIT 8-10 MEMBERS FROM EACH
 PARTICIPANT GROUP DESCRIBED ABOVE. THIS RECRUITMENT WILL TAKE PLACE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE SDP AS IT
 DIRECTLY ALIGNS WITH THEIR STRATEGIC MISSION. THIS CAB WILL MEET THREE TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF ONE
 CALENDAR YEAR TO ENGAGE WITH THE RESEARCH TEAM ON THE DESIGN OF THE STUDY IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING
 WITH ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF INITIAL FINDINGS.
 THE PRIMARY EVALUATION DATA COLLECTION TOOL WILL BE A SURVEY ADMINISTERED AT TWO TIME POINTS (FALL 2023
 AND SPRING 2024). THIS SURVEY WILL REPLICATE ONE OF FEW EXAMPLES OF AN EVALUATION OF CAB MEMBERSÃ‚  
 PERSPECTIVES. SPECIFICALLY, THE AUTHORS IN THIS STUDY CO-DEVELOPED A SURVEY WITH CAB MEMBERS WHICH
 ASSESSED FIVE DOMAINS: MISSION, COMMITMENT, COMMUNICATION, RESPECT/TRUST, AND TEAMWORK/
 BALANCE OF POWER. EACH DOMAIN HAS SEVERAL ITEMS AND ITEMS ARE SCORED USING A LIKERT-SCALE
 RESPONSE (I.E., STRONGLY DISAGREE-STRONGLY AGREE). IT ALSO INCORPORATED FREE-RESPONSE ITEMS SUCH AS
 Ã‚  WHY DID YOU INITIALLY JOIN THE CAB?Ã‚   AND Ã‚  WHAT ARE 3 WAYS THE CAB COULD IMPROVE OVER THE NEXT 6
 MONTHS?Ã‚  . MEETINGS WILL ALSO BE RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED TO PROVIDE RICH CONTEXTUAL DATA ON DISCUSSION
 TOPICS AND BARRIERS/FACILITATORS TO ENGAGING MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHICH MAY NOT BE OTHERWISE
 GATHERED THROUGH FORMAL DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES. DATA WILL BE ANALYZED THROUGH DESCRIPTIVE (LIKERT
 SCALE) AND INDUCTIVE QUALITATIVE (FREE RESPONSE, MEETING NOTES) METHODS TO BEST ANSWER THE STUDY AIMS
 AND PROVIDE RICH UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAB FORMATION.
 IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO UNDERTAKE AN EVALUATION OF CAB DEVELOPMENT THROUGH A
 HEALTH EQUITY LENS. FINDINGS WILL BE USED TO REFINE THE CAB OVER TIME AND MAY HELP OTHER RESEARCHERS
 NAVIGATE THIS PRACTICE IN A WAY THAT IS RESPECTFUL AND AVOIDS SUPERFICIAL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN

THE PROJECT WILL ALSO DEVELOP A PRIORITIZED RESEARCH AGENDA TO ADDRESS THE ASSOCIATED CHALLENGES THROUGH HOSTING A WORKING INSTITUTE OF ACADEMIC FACULTY, DOCTORAL STUDENTS, AND GLAM PRACTITIONERS.
 THE PROJECT WILL INCORPORATE TWO MAIN PHASES AND WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: WHAT ARE THE CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED RISKS MOST LIKELY TO PROVIDE THREATS TO GLAMS? HOW CAN CLIMATE CHANGE RISK FOR GLAMS BE UNDERSTOOD AS A CATEGORICAL SCALE WHEN COMBINING THOSE THREATS MOST LIKELY TO NEED SIGNIFICANT CONSIDERATION? WHAT ARE THE GLAM-SPECIFIC CLIMATE CHANGE CHALLENGES? HOW CAN A COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AGENDA BEST ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES WITH INPUT FROM PRACTITIONERS & ACADEMICS?

THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL INCORPORATE PRIOR EXPERIENCES INTO DEFINING GLAM-RELATED THREATS AND THE PROPOSED INSTITUTE WILL CREATE COLLABORATIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES.
 THE ANALYSIS WILL UTILIZE A COMPREHENSIVE GLAM DATASET PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED BY THE PIS WITH ASSISTANCE FROM 20 STUDENTS BETWEEN 2020-2022.

 OVER THE PAST DECADE, NAMIBIA HAS MADE IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS. THE RECENT NAMPHIA STUDY SHOWS THAT OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLHIV) AGED 15-64 YEARS, 86% REPORTED KNOWING THEIR HIV STATUS, AND ONCE DIAGNOSED OVER 90% OF PLHIV WERE LINKED TO ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) AND VIRALLY SUPPRESSED. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF NAMIBIA (GRN) HAS TAKEN DECISIVE STEPS TO SCALE UP BEST PRACTICES, INCLUDING INTEGRATING PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP) INTO THE NATIONAL ART GUIDELINES, INCREASING HIV TESTING ACCESS AND YIELD THROUGH TARGETED INDEX PARTNER TESTING AND HIV SELF-TESTING AND INTRODUCING COMMUNITY-BASED ART MODELS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED HIGH RETENTION RATES.
 
 DESPITE THIS PROGRESS, KEY AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONSÃ‚  PARTICULARLY SEX WORKERS (SWS), MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN (MSM), AND TRANSGENDER (TG) WOMENÃ‚  CONTINUE TO BE LEFT BEHIND. OVERALL HIV PREVALENCE AMONG ADULTS 15-49 STANDS AT 11.8% BUT RISES TO 53.2% AMONG SWS IN KATIMA MULILO AND KEETMANSHOOP AND 20.9% AMONG MSM IN WINDHOEK. WHILE LITTLE DATA ON TG MEN OR WOMEN ARE AVAILABLE, THE PLACE STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES (MOHSS) IN WINDHOEK FOUND THAT TG WOMEN REPORTED THE LOWEST RATES OF HIV TESTING AT 12%, COMPARED TO 30% AND 57% FOR FEMALE SWS (FSWS) AND MSM, RESPECTIVELY. TREATMENT COVERAGE FOR KEY POPULATIONS (KPS) WAS LOW (33.7% OF HIV-INFECTED FSWS AND 15% OF HIV-INFECTED MSM) WITH SIGNIFICANT LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP ALONG THE CONTINUUM OF HIV PREVENTION, CARE AND TREATMENT, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE RISK OF HIV TRANSMISSION OR REINFECTION OF HIV POSITIVE SEX PARTNERS. 
 
 RECENT DATA FROM IBBS STUDY DONE IN 2019 AT THREE SELECTED SITES OF KATIMA MULILO, WINDHOEK, WALVIS BAY & SWAKOPMUND HAS SHOWN THAT HIV PREVALENCE AMONG YOUNG FSW AGED 18-24 YEARS, A PROXY FOR HIV INCIDENCE, HAS REMAINED HIGH AND RANGES FROM 4.8% TO 27.4%. THERE IS A HIGH SYPHILIS PREVALENCE 8.9% AMONG FSW AND 30% OF KPS REPORTED NEVER USING A CONDOM, BOTH DATA POINTS INDICATING LOW UPTAKE OF PREVENTION INITIATIVES AND PERCEIVED RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION BY KP COMMUNITY. THE IBBS 2019 STUDY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE HIV VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION AMONG KPS REMAINS AT ALL STUDY SITES WITH 77.2%, 69.4% AND 28.3% AT WINDHOEK, KATIMA MULILO AND WALVIS BAY/SWAKOPMUND RESPECTIVELY. 
 
 THE KEY CHALLENGES FACING KPS INCLUDE HIGH RATES OF STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION (S&D) AND VIOLENCE AGAINST KPS; WEAK BIDIRECTIONAL LINKAGES/REFERRAL MECHANISMS BETWEEN COMMUNITY AND HEALTH FACILITY-BASED SERVICES; LACK OF KPSÃ‚   KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIV AND THEIR RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION AND HOW TO ACCESS SERVICES AND SUPPORT; AND A LACK OF HOLISTIC RESILIENCY AND RISK REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS. ACHIEVING AND SUSTAINING EPIDEMIC CONTROL IN NAMIBIA WILL REQUIRE A RAPID ACCELERATION OF THE HIV RESPONSE FOR KPS, USING COORDINATED, DATA-DRIVEN APPROACHES AT SCALE TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE MAJOR BIOMEDICAL, STRUCTURAL, AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS THAT INCREASE KPSÃ‚   VULNERABILITY TO HIV, ALONGSIDE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT OF KP-LED AND KP-SERVING ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO REACH THESE MOST HARD-TO-REACH POPULATIONS.
 
 UNDER KP-STAR, KPS WILL BENEFIT FROM SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF INTERVENTIONS SO THAT HIV TRANSMISSION IS REDUCED, AND PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV OBTAIN EARLY ACCESS TO SERVICES. OUR IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK PRIORITIZES KEY AREAS ALONG THE CASCADE THAT REQUIRE CONCENTRATED ATTENTION, INCLUDING TARGETED, HIGH-YIELD HTS APPROACHES; EARLY/SAME-DAY INITIATION ON ART; AND THE EXPANSION OF DIFFERENTIATED SERVICE DELIVERY (DSD) MODELS FOR KPS.

 THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: OBJECTIVE 1: BUILD UPON AND EXPAND
 WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH ENGAGEMENT WITH COMMUNITY PARTNER
 ORGANIZATIONS. TO REALIZE THIS FOUNDATIONAL OBJECTIVE, WE WILL EMPLOY MULTIPLE BEST PRACTICES
 FOR COMMUNITY-ENGAGED PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH (CHEVALIER & BUCKLES, 2019). A KEY
 STRATEGY WILL BE THE STRATEGIC USE OF REGULAR MEETINGS WITH COMMUNITY PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS AND
 AN ONGOING, CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH EACH SITEÃ‚  S DESIGNATED COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH
 COORDINATOR (CRC), PRIOR TO AND DURING ALL DATA COLLECTION. OBJECTIVE 2: CHARACTERIZE HOW
 COMMUNITY MEMBERS VIEW RECOVERY AND SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE, AND HOW THEY ASSESS
 PROGRESS MADE TOWARD RECOVERY. WE ANTICIPATE THAT RECOVERY, FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF
 PARTICIPANTS, WILL INCLUDE BOTH SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL COMPONENTS, AND THAT THESE WILL BE
 INTERLINKED (HYPOTHESIS 2A). THIS WILL LIKELY INCLUDE CREATING MORE FIRE-RESILIENT LANDSCAPES,
 INCLUDING EXPEDITED AND PRIORITIZED IMPLEMENTATION OF FIRE RISK REDUCTION AND RESTORATION
 PROJECTS (HYPOTHESIS 2B). HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT RECOVERY OBJECTIVES AND EFFORTS TOWARD
 SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE WILL VARY BY COMMUNITY, WITH SOME DEFINING RECOVERY AS ESSENTIALLY A
 RETURN TO A PRE-FIRE STATE, AND OTHERS DEFINING IT AS WORKING TOWARD FIRE-ADAPTED COMMUNITIES. WE
 ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT ADVANCED PREPARATION (SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL) WILL INFLUENCE HOW
 COMMUNITIES RECOVER POST-FIRE, INCLUDING THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS RESOURCES AND IMPLEMENT PROJECTS
 (HYPOTHESIS 2C). THE TRAJECTORY OF COMMUNITIES IN THEIR LONG-TERM RECOVERY WILL LIKELY BE
 INFLUENCED BY HOW THEY OPERATED PRIOR TO THE WILDLAND FIRE EVENT. OBJECTIVE 3: ASSESS THE EQUITY
 ISSUES OF COMMUNITY RECOVERY IN FIRE-ADAPTED LANDSCAPES, INCLUDING WHO IS IMPACTED BY PAST
 FIRES, WHO IS INVOLVED IN RECOVERY, WHO BENEFITS FROM RECOVERY EFFORTS, AND WHO HAS OR DOES NOT
 HAVE POWER IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING ADAPTIVE CAPACITY AND SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE. AS
 NOTED IN WILKINSON (2012), SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE SCHOLARS MAY OVERLOOK IMPORTANT
 MATTERS OF POWER, CONFLICT, AND CULTURE. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, WE WILL EXPLORE THE
 ANTICIPATED UNEVENNESS OF RECOVERY, ESPECIALLY THE LIKELIHOOD THAT VULNERABLE COMMUNITY
 MEMBERS MAY BE UNDERREPRESENTED IN RECOVERY EFFORTS (HYPOTHESIS 3A). OBJECTIVE 4: DESCRIBE
 THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL SOCIAL NETWORKS, INCLUDING LOCAL TO FEDERAL ORGANIZATIONS, WORKING
 TOWARD RECOVERY AND BUILDING SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE, HOW THEY INTERACT, AND HOW THEY
 IMPACT COMMUNITY RECOVERY EFFORTS.THE PARTICIPATION OF (LOCAL) COMMUNITY ACTORS AND
 ORGANIZATIONS IN THESE NETWORKS WILL LIKELY BE VITAL IN RECOVERY AND AS COMMUNITIES BUILD
 RESILIENCE, AND STATE AND FEDERAL ACTORS WILL RELY ON BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL LOCAL
 NETWORKS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES EFFECTIVELY (HYPOTHESIS 4A). WE ANTICIPATE THAT SOME
 PRE-EXISTING LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS WILL STEP UP AFTER DISASTER AND BE IMPORTANT PARTNERS IN RECOVERY,
 BUT THERE WILL ALSO BE NEWLY-FORMED GROUPS (FORMAL OR INFORMAL) THAT EMERGE AFTER DISASTER
 (BLACKMAN ET AL. 2017) (HYPOTHESIS 4B). WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT THE WILDFIRE RECOVERY PROCESS
 WILL AFFECT COMMUNITY-LEVEL SOCIAL COHESION, PERHAPS IN CONTRADICTORY WAYS, WITH SOME
 COMMUNITIES BUILDING HEIGHTENED COHESION AFTER FIRE, AND SOME EXPERIENCING INCREASED DISTRESS
 AND CONFLICT, AND SOME EXPERIENCING BOTH CONCURRENTLY (CARROLL ET AL., 2011) (HYPOTHESIS 4C).
 OBJECTIVE 5: DESCRIBE THE RESOURCES Ã‚   FINANCIAL, SOCIAL, AND HUMAN Ã‚   AVAILABLE TO FACILITATE
 COMMUNITY RECOVERY, AS WELL AS GAPS IN AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT
 SOME RESOURCES WILL BE BOLSTERED BY THE FIRE EVENT (HYPOTHESIS 5A). HOWEVER, THERE WILL LIKELY BE
 MISMATCH BETWEEN FUNDING, ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT PROJECTS (E.G., AVAILABLE WORKFORCE AND
 EQUIPMENT), AND POLICY CONSTRAINTS (HYPOTHESIS 5B).",assistance_sub,4/1/2023,4/1/2023,0,Single Action,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Small ($10K - $100K),0,5

ABSTRACT OF NIA-FUNDED R01 PARENT GRANT: DISCOVERY AND VALIDATION OF STRONG CANDIDATE BIOMARKERS AND CLINICAL ENDPOINTS FOR PAIN IS URGENTLY NEEDED THAT CAN BE USED TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NON-OPIOID PAIN THERAPEUTICS FROM DISCOVERY THROUGH PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS. EMERGING RESEARCH USING A COMBINATION OF BIOMARKERS DELIVER INDIVIDUALIZED PREDICTIONS ABOUT FUTURE BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH. OUR OWN FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT BEHAVIORAL CHRONIC PAIN CHARACTERISTICS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE BIOLOGICAL BIOMARKERS WHERE A GREATER PAIN BURDEN IS ASSOCIATED WITH ACCELERATED DETRIMENTAL BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES. HOWEVER, PROSPECTIVE RESEARCH IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO DETERMINE PAINÃ‚  S IMPACT ON THE HETEROGENEITY OF THESE BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL TO ELUCIDATE THE UNDERLYING PATTERNS OF BIOLOGICAL CHANGES USING A BIOBEHAVIORAL PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS NEEDED FOR PREDICTING FUTURE HEALTH AND TO BE ABLE TO USE AS CLINICAL ENDPOINTS FOR INTERVENTIONS. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL PROSPECTIVELY ADDRESS BIOBEHAVIORAL FACTORS (I.E., COGNITIVE, PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL) AFFECTING THE EXPERIENCE AND INTERPRETATION OF KNEE PAIN AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION ACROSS RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUPS OVER TIME. WE WILL PROSPECTIVELY ASSESS PAIN ALONG WITH MULTIPLE BIOMARKERS AS PREDICTORS OF COGNITIVE, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONAL PROGRESSION AMONG MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER NON-HISPANIC BLACKS AND NON-HISPANIC WHITES WITH KNEE PAIN AND CONTROLS OVER A FOUR-YEAR STUDY PERIOD. WITH STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA, OUR INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT, USING A COMPREHENSIVE BIOBEHAVIORAL MULTI-METHODS APPROACH, WE WILL BE THE FIRST TO PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINE THE TRAJECTORY AND INTERACTIONS AMONG PAIN, BIOLOGICAL BIOMARKERS AND MULTIPLE DOMAINS OF FUNCTION WITHIN RACE/ETHNIC GROUPS IN OA PAIN. FINDINGS WILL CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF PAIN AND ITS BIOBEHAVIORAL BASIS, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE RACE/ETHNIC GROUP DISPARITIES AND IMPROVE PAIN-RELATED HEALTH AND FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES. B. OVERVIEW OF SUPPLEMENT PROJECT: B.1. PARENT GRANT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT IS TO PROVIDE VALUABLE RESEARCH AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ANTOINETTE SPECTOR, PT, DPT, PHD, A HIGHLY PROMISING EARLY STAGE INVESTIGATOR WITH OUTSTANDING TRAINING IN REHABILITATION SCIENCE WHO RECENTLY JOINED THE FACULTY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN- MILWAUKEE (UWM). DR. SPECTOR WILL PURSUE RESEARCH AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES SUPPORTED BY THE PARENT GRANT (R01AG067757) ENTITLED Ã‚  BIOBEHAVIORAL BASIS OF KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS PAIN.Ã‚   THE PARENT GRANT AIMS TO (I) TO CHARACTERIZE PAIN AND RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUP DIFFERENCES IN DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS ACCOUNTING FOR FACTORS ALREADY KNOWN TO CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH DISPARITIES, (II) TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN THE PROGRESSION OF PAIN, BRAIN MARKERS AND FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY OVER A 2-4-YEAR PERIOD ARE EXPLAINED BY DIFFERENCES IN DNA METHYLATION, AND (III) TO IDENTIFY A DNA METHYLATION SIGNATURE BY RACE/ETHNICITY PREDICTIVE OF FUNCTIONAL DECLINE AND DISABILITY OVER THE 4-YEAR PERIOD. THIS PARENT PROJECT OFFERS AN IDEAL OPPORTUNITY FOR DR. SPECTOR, A PHYSICAL THERAPIST AND PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENTIST, TO BUILD EXPERTISE IN PAIN DISPARITIES AND AGING RESEARCH, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON ENHANCING HER KNOWLEDGE REGARDING NEUROBIOLOGICAL MEDIATORS OF HEALTH DISPARITIES IN OLDER ADULTS. DR. SPECTORÃ‚  S LONG-TERM GOALS ARE TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENTLY FUNDED, PRODUCTIVE RESEARCHER INVESTIGATING THE RELATIONSHIPS OF SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS, AND PAIN DISPARITIES AMONG WOMEN ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE. AS PART OF THE SUPPLEMENT, DR. SPECTOR WILL BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AGING PROCESSES, BUILD HER SKILLS IN ADVANCED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS INCORPORATING BIOLOGICAL MARKERS, AND ENHANCE HER MANUSCRIPT AND GRANT WRITING SKILLS, AS DETAILED IN HER CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND MENTORSHIP PLAN. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS, SHE WILL BE GUIDED BY LEADING RESEARCHERS AT THE PAIN RESEARCH AND INTERVENTION CENTER OF EXCELLENCE (PRICE), UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA, WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN PAIN AND AGING NEUROSCIENCE (DR. CRUZ-ALMEIDA) AND CLINICAL PAIN IN AGING (DR. FILLINGIM), AS WELL AS HER LOCAL MENTOR, DR. AMANDA SIMANEK (UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MILWAUKEE) WITH EXPERTISE IN SOCIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ANALYTIC METHODS FOR ASSESSING MEDIATION. DR. SPECTOR WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH DR. CRUZ-ALMEIDA (PI ON THE PARENT GRANT AND PRIMARY MENTOR ON THIS SUPPLEMENT) ON ALL THREE PARENT GRANT AIMS WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON PAIN DISPARITIES AMONG WOMEN AND WILL ALSO HAVE FREQUENT INTERACTION WITH ALL OTHER MEMBERS OF THE MENTORING TEAM REGARDING HER RESEARCH AND TRAINING ACTIVITIES. TO AUGMENT HER TRAINING PLAN, SHE WILL ENROLL IN FORMAL COURSES TO INCLUDE NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING, SOCIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY, ADVANCED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, AND GRANT WRITING. DR. SPECTOR WILL ALSO ENHANCE HER CAREER DEVELOPMENT BY REGULARLY ATTENDING PRICE RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOPS AND BY ATTENDING SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCES DURING THE FUNDING PERIOD OF THE SUPPLEMENT. B.2. RESEARCH PLAN: OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS A GLOBAL LEADING CAUSE OF YEARS LIVED WITH DISABILITY IN THE AGING POPULATION1, WITH THE KNEE BEING THE MOST COMMONLY AFFECTED JOINT. WOMEN ARE AT INCREASED RISK OF EXPERIENCING THE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES OF KNEE OA, COMPARED TO MEN, INCLUDING HIGHER INCIDENCE2, GREATER PAIN SEVERITY2,3 AND SENSITIVITY TO NOXIOUS STIMULI4, AND WORSE FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE.5 KNEE OA BURDEN IS ALSO HIGHER AMONG NON-HISPANIC BLACK (NHB) INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF BOTH RADIOGRAPHIC AND SYMPTOMATIC KNEE OA COMPARED TO NON- HISPANIC WHITE (NHW) INDIVIDUALS6,7. NHBS ALSO EXPERIENCE INCREASED EXPERIMENTAL PAIN SENSITIVITY8 WITH MORE SEVERE AND DISABLING KNEE OA PAIN.9Ã‚  11 AS THE AGING US POPULATION GROWS AND IS INCREASINGLY MADE UP OF WOMEN AND RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES, THE SIGNIFICANT BURDEN OF KNEE OA REPRESENTS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY BASED ON ITS CONSIDERABLE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON FUNCTIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND WELL-BEING.12 PAIN DISPARITIES CAN ARISE FROM MULTIPLE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES SUCH AS DIFFERENCES IN SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, EDUCATION, STRESS, EXPOSURE TO RACISM AND HEALTH BEHAVIORS (I.E., DIET, EXERCISE). ALTHOUGH LIMITED, THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT INTERACTIONS BY SEX AND RACE MAY LEAD TO AN ADDITIVE EFFECT THAT CAN INCREASE THE KNEE OA BURDEN FOR NHB WOMEN COMPARED TO NHW WOMEN. AMONG WOMEN WITH OA, NHBS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF DISABILITY THAN NHWS, IN ADDITION TO REPORTING MORE LIFE STRESSORS, INCLUDING DISPROPORTIONATE EXPERIENCES OF DISCRIMINATION AND FINANCIAL STRAIN.13 DIFFERENTIAL SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES THAT CAN BE ADVERSELY INFLUENCED BY BOTH RACE AND GENDER COULD POTENTIALLY COMPOUND THE RISK FOR NHB WOMEN AND INCREASE THEIR ODDS TO EXPERIENCE POORER PAIN OUTCOMES. YET, THERE IS LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SOCIOENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES DIFFER AMONG NHB AND NHW WOMEN WITH KNEE OA AND THE SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE DIFFERENCES TO PAIN DISPARITIES. MOREOVER, THERE IS A DEARTH OF RESEARCH ON THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH THESE SOCIALLY-PATTERNED RISK FACTORS BECOME PHYSICALLY EMBODIED, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS, SUCH AS EPIGENETICS, CAN EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AND PAIN DISPARITIES AMONG WOMEN WITH KNEE OA. EPIGENETICS IS A POTENTIAL MECHANISM BY WHICH DIFFERENCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AND STRESSORS MAY LEAD TO RACIAL DISPARITIES IN KNEE OA. EPIGENETICS REFERS TO GENE EXPRESSION DIFFERENCES IN THE ABSENCE OF DNA SEQUENCE VARIATION, RESULTING IN DIFFERENT PHENOTYPES. IN PARTICULAR, DNA METHYLATION HAS BEEN THE MOST STUDIED EPIGENETIC MECHANISM IN HUMANS MAINLY BECAUSE ITS STABILITY MAKES COLLECTION, STORAGE AND ANALYSIS MORE FEASIBLE.14 THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INFLUENCE DNA METHYLATION AND CAN LEAD TO ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES.15Ã‚  18 AN INCREASING LITERATURE IN ANIMALS19,20 AND HUMANS21Ã‚  23 IMPLICATES DNA METHYLATION IN PAIN. RECENT FINDINGS FROM OUR STUDY TEAM SUGGEST THAT PATTERNS OF DNA METHYLATION DIFFER FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC PAIN COMPARED TO CONTROLS AND THAT DNA METHYLATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PAIN, AND COGNITIVE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION24. STILL, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER DNA METHYLATION STATUS PROCESSES EXPLAIN ETHNIC/RACE DIFFERENCES IN PAIN PROGRESSION AND FUNCTIONAL DECLINE, OVERALL, AND IF THERE ARE DISTINCT PROCESSES THAT CAN EXPLAIN ETHNIC/RACE DIFFERENCES AMONG WOMEN. DISTINGUISHING DNA METHYLATION STATUS PROCESSES AMONG WOMEN COULD PROVIDE A BIOLOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIOENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND KNEE OA PAIN IN THIS HIGH-RISK POPULATION. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH OBJECTIVES OF THIS SUPPLEMENT ARE TO: 1) CHARACTERIZE ETHNIC/RACE DIFFERENCES IN BASELINE CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PAIN, DNA METHYLATION STATUS, AND SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES AMONG NHB AND NHW WOMEN WITH KNEE OA; 2) IDENTIFY ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN SOCIOENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, CHANGES IN EPIGENETIC AGE, AND PAIN PROGRESSION AND FUNCTIONAL DECLINE OVER A 2 YEAR PERIOD AMONG OLDER NHB AND NHW WOMEN WITH KNEE OA; 3) ELUCIDATE THE PATHWAYS BETWEEN SOCIOENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, DNA METHYLATION STATUS, AND PAIN PROGRESSION AND FUNCTIONAL DECLINE OVER A 2 YEAR PERIOD. B.3. STUDY DESIGN: TO ACCOMPLISH THESE OBJECTIVES, DR. SPECTOR WILL CONDUCT ANALYSES ON LONGITUDINAL DATA OBTAINED FROM WOMEN ENROLLED IN THE UNDERSTANDING PAIN AND LIMITATIONS OF OSTEOARTHRITIC DISEASE (UPLOAD) STUDY: (MERIT R37AG033906, R01AG054370, FYS: 2014-2021). THE SAMPLE INCLUDES MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER NHW (N= 75) AND NHB (N= 60) WOMEN WITH KNEE OA WHO HAVE COMPLETED MULTIPLE ASSESSMENT SESSIONS THAT COLLECTED BLOOD, DEMOGRAPHIC, MEDICAL AND LIFE HISTORY, CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PAIN, NEUROIMAGING AND PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA AT BASELINE AND TWO-YEAR FOLLOW-UP VISITS. FOR THE PROPOSED RESEARCH, THE PRIMARY SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE OF INTEREST IS THE AREA DEPRIVATION INDEX (ADI). THE ADI WILL ALLOW US TO QUANTIFY THE LEVEL OF NEIGHBORHOOD DEPRIVATION FOR EACH UPLOAD PARTICIPANT BASED ON THEIR 9-DIGIT HOUSEHOLD ZIP CODE.25 THE ADI PROVIDES A MORE ROBUST WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR SOCIAL DEPRIVATION BASED ON COMMUNITY-LEVEL FACTORS, INCLUDING EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, AND HOUSING.25 ALTHOUGH THE ADI HAD BEEN INCREASINGLY UTILIZED TO UNDERSTAND HEALTH DISPARITIES ACROSS A DIVERSE RANGE OF HEALTH OUTCOMES, IT HAS BEEN UNDERUTILIZED IN OA PAIN DISPARITIES RESEARCH, OVERALL, AND PARTICULARLY AMONG WOMEN, WHERE THERE IS EMERGING EVIDENCE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ETHNIC-RACE DISPARITIES IN SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND WORSE FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES AMONG NHB WOMEN.13,26,27 A SECOND SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURE WILL BE THE EXPERIENCES OF DISCRIMINATION SCALE (EOD), A MEASURE OF SELF-REPORTED INCIDENCES OF DISCRIMINATION OVER AN INDIVIDUALÃ‚  S LIFETIME, INCLUDING EVENT FREQUENCY, REASON FOR OCCURRENCES, AMOUNT OF WORRY RELATED TO EACH EVENT, AND RESPONSE TO EVENTS. THE EOD IS A RELIABLE AND VALID MEASURE WITH HIGHER SCORES INDICATING GREATER EXPERIENCES OF DISCRIMINATION.28 THE THIRD SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE WILL BE THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALE OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT SCALE (MSPSS). THE MSPSS IS A WIDELY USED, VALIDATED MEASURED THAT HAS THREE SUBSCALES ADDRESSING DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOCIAL SUPPORT (FAMILY, FRIENDS, SIGNIFICANT OTHERS).29,30 FOR THE MSPSS, LOWER SCORES INDICATE LESS PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT. THE MAIN OUTCOME WILL BE KNEE OA PAIN AND FUNCTION USING THE WESTERN ONTARIO AND MCMASTER UNIVERSITIES OSTEOARTHRITIS INDEX (WOMAC). THE WOMAC IS A VALIDATED PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURE31 THAT HAS BEEN USED EXTENSIVELY IN CLINICAL RESEARCH TO ASSESS KNEE OA SYMPTOMOLOGY AND DISABILITY. IT HAS THREE SUBSCALE SCORES FOR PAIN, STIFFNESS, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION, AND A TOTAL SCORE, OR WOMAC INDEX, FOR OVERALL DISABILITY; HIGHER SCORES INDICATE WORSENING STATUS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT:1) NHB WOMEN WILL HAVE HIGHER NEIGHBORHOOD DEPRIVATION (ADI), AND PAIN SEVERITY AND WORSE PHYSICAL FUNCTION COMPARED TO NHW WOMEN AND IN TURN, DNA METHYLATION STATUS OF GENES IN THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS (E.G., GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR GENE (NR3C1), NERVE GROWTH FACTOR INDUCIBLE PROTEIN-A (NGFI-A)) AS WELL AS REGULATION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM (E.G., HYPOMETHYLATION OF PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES VERSUS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES); 2) COMBINED FACTORS OF SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES (HIGHER ADI, MORE FREQUENT EXPERIENCES OF DISCRIMINATION, AND LESS PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT) ALONG WITH DNA METHYLATION STATUS WILL PREDICT PROGRESSION OF PAIN SEVERITY AND FUNCTIONAL DECLINE OVER THE 2-YEAR PERIOD; AND 3) DNA METHYLATION STATUS WILL MEDIATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND PROGRESSION OF PAIN SEVERITY AND FUNCTIONAL DECLINE OVER THE 2-YEAR PERIOD. B.4. DATA ANALYSIS: TO TEST THE STATED HYPOTHESES, DR. SPECTORÃ‚  S PROPOSED ANALYTIC METHODS WILL CHARACTERIZE ETHNIC-RACE DIFFERENCES IN THE SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, DNA METHYLATION STATUS, AND OA KNEE PAIN AND DISABILITY AT BASELINE (AIM 1). SHE WILL NEXT INCORPORATE HIERARCHICAL REGRESSION TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, DNA METHYLATION STATUS, AND PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS PREDICT THE PROGRESSION OF KNEE PAIN AND FUNCTIONAL DECLINE OVER THE 2-YEAR TIME PERIOD (AIM 2). FINALLY, MEDIATION MODELS WILL BE USED TO TEST THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY EFFECTS OF SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES ON THE PROGRESSION OF KNEE PAIN AND FUNCTIONAL DECLINE ARE MEDIATED BY DNA METHYLATION STATUS (AIM 3). WHILE DR. SPECTOR HAS EXPERIENCE PERFORMING REGRESSION ANALYSES ON CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA, SHE WILL GAIN NEW EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING STATISTICAL ANALYSES ON LONGITUDINAL DATA BY WORKING CLOSELY WITH DR. ZHIGUANG HUO (BIOSTATISTICS CO-INVESTIGATOR OF THE PARENT GRANT). C. CANDIDATE BACKGROUND AND GOALS: THE CANDIDATE FOR THIS DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT IS ANTOINETTE SPECTOR, PT, DPT, PHD, AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MILWAUKEE (UWM). DR. SPECTOR EARNED HER PHD IN PUBLIC AND COMMUNITY HEALTH FROM THE MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN IN 2021. SHE ALSO HAS A DOCTOR OF PHYSICAL THERAPY (DPT) DEGREE FROM CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY WISCONSIN (2006) AND WAS BOARD-CERTIFIED AS AN ORTHOPEDIC CLINICAL SPECIALIST DURING HER TIME IN CLINICAL PRACTICE (2009-2019). CURRENTLY IN HER FIRST YEAR AS TENURE-TRACK FACULTY, THIS DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT WOULD FACILITATE AN INTENSIVE PERIOD OF PROTECTED TIME FOR DR. SPECTOR TO PURSUE ADVANCED TRAINING AND MENTORSHIP IN PAIN AND AGING RESEARCH TO LAUNCH HER INDEPENDENT RESEARCH CAREER INVESTIGATING PAIN DISPARITIES AMONG WOMEN. DR. SPECTOR IS PURSUING THIS DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT THROUGH A PARENT AWARD AT AN OUTSIDE INSTITUTION FOR SEVERAL REASONS: 1) THE RESEARCH PROPOSED IN THE PARENT AWARD IS HIGHLY CONSISTENT WITH HER RESEARCH INTERESTS AND CAREER GOALS; 2) THE UF PRICE IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS A NATIONAL LEADER IN PAIN AND AGING RESEARCH, WITH A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON RACE-ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN PAIN AND POTENTIAL UNDERLYING NEUROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS; 3) DR. SPECTOR HAS BEEN ENGAGED WITH PRICE FOR RESEARCH MENTORING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, FROM WHICH SHE HAS BENEFITTED SUBSTANTIALLY; AND 4) WHILE HER CURRENT INSTITUTION IS HIGHLY SUPPORTIVE OF HER RESEARCH CAREER DEVELOPMENT, THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SUPPORTING PAIN DISPARITIES RESEARCH IS LIMITED. THE DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT IS FURTHER JUSTIFIED, AS DR. SPECTOR WENT STRAIGHT FROM HER DOCTORAL TRAINING INTO A TENURE-TRACK FACULTY POSITION, WITHOUT THE BENEFITS OF POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING. THEREFORE, THE DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT WILL PROVIDE THE MUCH NEEDED PROTECTED TIME TO SUPPORT HER CONTINUED RESEARCH CAREER DEVELOPMENT. HER CURRENT INSTITUTION IS HIGHLY SUPPORTIVE OF THESE EFFORTS (SEE LETTER FROM DR. JAY KAPELLUSCH). C.1. PERSONAL STATEMENT (PROVIDED BY THE CANDIDATE): MY PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN AND CLINICIAN IN THE ORTHOPEDIC PHYSICAL THERAPY SETTING HAVE BEEN FORMATIVE TO MY RESEARCH APPROACH TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ON THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF POPULATIONS WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE. MY GRANDPARENTS WERE BORN IN THE SOUTH AND CAME OF AGE IN THE JIM CROW ERA. LIKE MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS OF THAT TIME, MY GRANDPARENTS WERE PART OF THE GREAT MIGRATION WHICH LANDED THEM IN INDIANA, WHERE I WAS RAISED. THROUGH MY GRANDPARENTSÃ‚   STORIES DETAILING THE HARDSHIPS THEY ENCOUNTERED DURING THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE, AND THOSE OF MY PARENTS Ã‚   WHO WERE BOTH PART OF MANDATORY SCHOOL INTEGRATION AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS AT PREDOMINANTLY WHITE INSTITUTIONS Ã‚   I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A STRONG DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE EXPERIENCES HAVE SHAPED THEIR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING AND THE HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT IÃ‚  VE OBSERVED WITHIN MY OWN FAMILY AND COMMUNITY. IÃ‚  VE ALSO BEEN ENDLESSLY FASCINATED BY HOW THESE TRAJECTORIES HAVE DIFFERED BASED ON OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS GENDER. LIFETIME EXPERIENCES AND HEALTH OUTCOMES HAVE DIFFERED DRASTICALLY BETWEEN MY GRANDMOTHERS AND GRANDFATHERS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS THEY EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFETIMES, AS WELL AS THEIR STRATEGIES TO COPE WITH THESE EXPERIENCES. ADDITIONALLY, IÃ‚  VE OBSERVED GENDER DIFFERENCES AMONG MY ORTHOPEDIC PATIENTS, WHO WERE PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN SEEKING TREATMENT FOR PAIN CONDITIONS WHILE CONCURRENTLY MANAGING OTHER COMPETING PRIORITIES, ESPECIALLY JOB AND CAREGIVING RESPONSIBILITIES THAT HAD OFTEN TAKEN A PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL TOLL ON THEM. THESE COMPETING PRIORITIES, WHICH APPEARED TO DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT MY PATIENTS WHO WERE WOMEN, HAD SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES REGARDING THEIR TREATMENT ENGAGEMENT SUCH AS NOT SEEKING TREATMENT UNTIL SYMPTOMS WERE SEVERE AND DEBILITATING AND A REDUCED CAPACITY TO SELF-MANAGE SYMPTOMS OVER TIME. WHEN I BECAME A WORKING MOTHER, I BECAME INCREASINGLY ATTUNED TO THE CHALLENGES THESE WOMEN FACED AND HOW IT COULD BE EVEN HARDER TO CLEAR THESE HURDLES WITHOUT STABLE HOUSING, PAID MEDICAL LEAVE, RELIABLE CHILDCARE OR SOCIAL SUPPORT. WHEN I MADE THE DECISION TO PURSUE MY PHD AFTER A DECADE IN CLINICAL PRACTICE, IT WAS WITH THE INTENTION TO HAVE AN IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE IN HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH THAT FOCUSED ON THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. DURING MY DOCTORAL STUDIES, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON THREE FEDERALLY FUNDED EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES THAT EXAMINED THE: 1) ROLE OF RESIDENTIAL RACIAL SEGREGATION ON BREAST CANCER OUTCOMES AMONG NHB AND NHW WOMEN; 2) EFFECTS OF A SUPPORTIVE HOUSING INTERVENTION ON THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD EXPERIENCED CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS; AND 3) RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE LAWS AND POLICIES ON OPIOID MISUSE INITIATION AND TRANSITIONS TO HEROIN, FENTANYL, AND INJECTION DRUG USE. MY DOCTORAL COURSES AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE STUDIES PROVIDED A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR ME TO PURSUE RESEARCH ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND HEALTH DISPARITIES ACROSS A DIVERSE RANGE OF POPULATIONS. AS I EMBARK ON MY CAREER AS AN EARLY STAGE INVESTIGATOR IN REHABILITATION SCIENCE, I WANT TO FOCUS MY SCHOLARLY EFFORTS ON THE HEALTH DISPARITIES EXPERIENCED BY WOMEN IN THE AREAS OF PAIN AND AGING, WHICH WILL ALLOW ME TO MORE FULLY DRAW ON BOTH MY DOCTORAL RESEARCH AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCES. THE OVERARCHING GOALS OF MY WOMEN-FOCUSED RESEARCH PROGRAM ARE TO [1] IDENTIFY SOCIOENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS OF PAIN DISPARITIES ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE; [2] ELUCIDATE BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS LINKING SOCIOENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND PAIN DISPARITIES; AND [3] DEVELOP MULTILEVEL INTERVENTIONS TO ENHANCE PAIN MANAGEMENT IN UNDERSERVED WOMEN. C.2. PROGRESS MADE IN PREVIOUS DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT: I WAS AWARDED A DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE TO COMPLETE MY DISSERTATION RESEARCH, WHICH USED QUALITATIVE METHODS TO EXPLORE THE SOCIAL AND STRUCTURAL CONTEXT OF OPIOID MISUSE INITIATION AND TREATMENT-SEEKING AMONG WOMEN. MY DISSERTATION FINDINGS HIGHLIGHTED HOW THE CONFLUENCE OF PAIN-RELATED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND SOCIAL FACTORS, SUCH AS EXPOSURE TO CHILDHOOD MALTREATMENT AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE, INCREASED WOMENÃ‚  S VULNERABILITY FOR OPIOID MISUSE. MOREOVER, ONCE WOMEN INITIATED OPIOID MISUSE, THEIR SHARED EXPERIENCES OF DISCRIMINATION, POVERTY, LIMITED TREATMENT OPTIONS, AND CHILDCARE RESPONSIBILITIES IMPEDED THEIR CAPACITY TO SEEK SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT SERVICES, DESPITE THEIR DESIRES TO DO SO. THE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT PROVIDED PROTECTED TIME AND RESEARCH RESOURCES THAT ALLOWED ME TO: COMPLETE MY DISSERTATION ON TIME (EVEN DURING A PANDEMIC), PUBLISH SEVERAL MANUSCRIPTS AS LEAD32,33 AND CO-AUTHOR34Ã‚  37, PRESENT MY RESEARCH AT SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS, AND RECEIVE MULTIPLE AWARDS BASED ON MY WORK. MY HIGH LEVEL OF PRODUCTIVITY AS A GRADUATE STUDENT, MADE POSSIBLE BY THE DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT PROGRAM, POSITIONED ME TO BE A COMPETITIVE APPLICANT FOR TENURE-TRACK FACULTY POSITIONS DURING MY FIRST APPLICATION CYCLE, PERMITTING ME TO BYPASS POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING. BASED ON THE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE I HAD WITH MY PREVIOUS SUPPLEMENT, AND MY DESIRE TO GAIN EXPERIENCE IN PAIN DISPARITIES AND AGING RESEARCH AMONG WOMEN, I AM SEEKING ADDITIONAL DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT FUNDING TO PROVIDE PROTECTED TIME DURING MY FIRST TWO YEARS ON THE TENURE-TRACK TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE FOR A NIA K01 CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD, WHICH WOULD PLACE ME ANOTHER STEP CLOSER TO ACHIEVING MY GOAL OF BECOMING AN INDEPENDENTLY FUNDED AND PRODUCTIVE RESEARCHER. C.3. CAREER GOALS: 1. SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE FOR A NIA K01 CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD 2. PUBLISH AT LEAST 4 MANUSCRIPTS ANNUALLY, TWO AS LEAD AUTHOR AND TWO AS CO-AUTHOR 3. BUILD A ROBUST AND PRODUCTIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM IN THE AREA OF PAIN DISPARITIES AND AGING AMONG WOMEN 4. DEVELOP A CADRE OF RESEARCH TRAINEES WHO ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN PAIN AND AGING RESEARCH AND THE SCIENTIFIC WORKFORCE D. CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND MENTORSHIP PLAN: THE PROPOSED CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND MENTORSHIP PLAN IS DESIGNED TO HELP THE CANDIDATE, DR. SPECTOR, ACHIEVE HER CAREER GOALS. THE RECOMMENDED PLAN INCLUDES A COMBINATION OF EXPERIENTIAL AND DIDACTIC TRAINING ACTIVITIES (TABLE 1) THAT WILL PROVIDE DR. SPECTOR WITH HANDS-ON RESEARCH EXPERIENCE, INCREASED KNOWLEDGE IN RELEVANT SUBJECT AREAS, AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AS A RESULT OF THIS TRAINING PROGRAM, DR. SPECTOR WILL BECOME A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CANDIDATE FOR A CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD, WHICH WILL FURTHER ENHANCE HER CAPACITY TO ACHIEVE HER LONG-TERM GOAL TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENTLY FUNDED, PRODUCTIVE SCIENTIST INVESTIGATING PAIN DISPARITIES AMONG WOMEN ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE. THE SUPPLEMENT IS INTENDED TO ACHIEVE FOUR SPECIFIC CAREER DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES: 1) EXPERIENTIAL TRAINING IN PAIN DISPARITIES AND AGING RESEARCH; 2) INTENSIVE TRAINING IN PAIN AND AGING PROCESSES AND SOCIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY; 3) DEVELOPMENT OF MANUSCRIPT AND GRANT WRITING SKILLS IN THE AREA OF PAIN DISPARITIES AMONG WOMEN; 4) ESTABLISH NETWORKS IN PAIN AND AGING RESEARCH TO FOSTER FUTURE CAREER COLLABORATION. SHE WILL ACCOMPLISH THESE TRAINING GOALS UNDER THE MENTORSHIP OF DR. YENISEL CRUZ-ALMEIDA AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA, PI OF THE PARENT GRANT, TENURED ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF PRICE, DR. ROGER FILLINGIM AT UF, CO-INVESTIGATOR ON THE PARENT GRANT, DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR AND DIRECTOR OF PRICE, AND THROUGH THE MENTORSHIP OF DR. AMANDA SIMANEK AT UWM, AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR WITH TENURE AND SOCIAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST. DR. SIMANEK MOST RECENTLY COMPLETED A NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES-FUNDED STUDY EXAMINING THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MATERNAL SOCIOECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE DURING PREGNANCY, ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES AND FETAL PROGRAMMING OF INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE. ADDITIONALLY, SHE WAS SUPPORTED AS A 2019-2020 MARMOT PRINCE MAHIDOL FELLOW IN THE INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH EQUITY AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PRENATAL SOCIOECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE AND EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS AT BIRTH AND WHETHER THESE ASSOCIATIONS VARY ACROSS MOTHERÃ‚  S ETHNICITY. NOTABLY, DR.Ã‚  S CRUZ-ALMEIDA AND FILLINGIM STRONGLY SUPPORT DR. SPECTORÃ‚  S RESEARCH AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT. SPECIFICALLY, THEY HAVE COMMITTED TO MEETING WITH DR. SPECTOR ON A WEEKLY BASIS, MAKING DATA AVAILABLE TO DR. SPECTOR FROM THE PARENT GRANT IN SUPPORT OF HER RESEARCH GOALS, AND ASSISTING WITH HER SKILL DEVELOPMENT IN MANUSCRIPT AND GRANT WRITING. MOREOVER, DR. SPECTOR WILL BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE VIRTUALLY IN ALL PRICE TRAINING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. DR. SPECTORÃ‚  S CAREER DEVELOPMENT WILL BE FURTHER SUPPORTED BY MENTORING AT HER HOME INSTITUTION FROM DR. SIMANEK, AND DR. SPECTOR WILL MEET WITH THE ENTIRE MENTORING TEAM AT LEAST TWICE PER YEAR.

 THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE LAACES PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE THE ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENTS AT MCNEESE STATE UNIVERSITY WITH TRUE HANDS-ON EXPERIENCES ON ELECTRONICS, THERMAL/VIBRATION ISOLATION, CIRCUIT DESIGN, PROGRAMMING, PROJECT MANAGEMENT, EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, AND DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. 
 SINCE THE 2013-2014 ACADEMIC YEAR, THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE AT MCNEESE STATE UNIVERSITY HAS COMPLETED MORE THAN 15 LAACES PAYLOADS. THESE TEAMS COMPLETED THE PROPOSED TASKS AND LAUNCHED THEIR PAYLOADS IN MAY EVERY YEAR. THESE TEAM MEMBERS SERVE AS EXEMPLARY STUDENTS TO RECRUIT MORE STUDENTS. VARIOUS FACULTY ADVISORS FORMED A COMMITTEE TO MENTOR THESE STUDENT TEAMS REGULARLY. WE PROVIDED STUDENT TRAINING IN THE FALL SEMESTER. IN THE SPRING SEMESTER, WE MET WITH THESE TEAMS AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK. WE HAVE ALSO HAD A DESIGNATED SPACE LAB SINCE 2019.
 IN THE 2022-2023 ACADEMIC YEAR, WE PLAN TO FORM TWO TEAMS, FOCUSING ON THE 2023 PARTIAL SOLAR ECLIPSE AND THE 2024 TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ALIGN WITH NASA'S SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE (SMD). BOTH PAYLOAD DESIGNS ARE RELATED TO EARTH SCIENCE.
 2. PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTING THE STUDENT BALLOONING COURSE
 3. PLAN TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN STUDENT PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAM
 WE PLAN TO FORM TWO STUDENT TEAMS AND RECRUIT EIGHT STUDENTS WITH GREAT DIVERSITY. IN THE PAST WE TYPICALLY RECEIVED THIRTY TO FORTY APPLICATIONS EVERY YEAR. THE LAACES COMMITTEE INTERVIEWED ALL THE APPLICANTS. WE HIRE STUDENTS BASED ON THEIR INTEREST, TECHNICAL BACKGROUND, AND AVAILABILITY. EVERY YEAR WE HAD GREAT DIVERSITIES IN STUDENT TEAMS INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS, FEMALE STUDENTS, AND UNDER-REPRESENTED STUDENTS. WE EXPECT A SIMILAR PROCEDURE THIS YEAR. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FALL SEMESTER (AUGUST 2022), WE WILL ANNOUNCE THE LAACES PROGRAM TO ALL ENGINEERING, COMPUTER SCIENCE, AND PHYSICS MAJOR STUDENTS. AFTER COLLECTING APPLICATIONS, WE WILL INTERVIEW ALL APPLICANTS AND CHOOSE STUDENTS TO FIT THE TWO STUDENT TEAMS. THE PROCESS WILL BE COMPLETE BEFORE THE LABOR DAY. SO THE LAACES TRAINING SESSIONS CAN START IN EARLY SEPTEMBER.
 THESE STUDENTS ARE FROM FOUR MAJORS: MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, COMPUTER SCIENCE, AND PHYSICS. SENIOR STUDENTS WILL FORM A CAPSTONE TEAM, SO THEY WILL BE DIRECTED BY BOTH THE LAACES AND CAPSTONE COMMITTEES. THE OTHER TEAM CONSISTS OF SOPHOMORES AND JUNIORS. IN THIS WAY, WE FORM A LADDER OF STUDENTS. THESE CAN KEEP WORKING IN FUTURE LAACES PROJECTS. IN THE MEANTIME, THEY ARE EXEMPLARY STUDENTS TO HAVE POSITIVE IMPACT ON OTHER STUDENTS. DURING THE APPLICATION/HIRING PROCESS, WE WOULD PURPOSELY TRY TO RECRUIT MORE QUALIFIED UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY FOR SOPHOMORES AND JUNIORS. THE EXPERIENCE WILL MOTIVATE THEIR INTERESTS IN THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION.

ABUSE COMES IN MANY FORMS WHERE CHILDREN, PETS, FINANCIAL SECURITY AND RESIDENTIAL STABILITY ARE OFTEN USED AS MEANS TO CONTROL AND MANIPULATE THE VICTIM. DV DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AND IT CROSSES CRIMINAL JUSTICE, HEALTH, SOCIAL SERVICES AND ECONOMIC SECTORS. THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS PROPOSAL IS THE IMPACT OF DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN GREENE COUNTY (GC) AND THE SUBSEQUENT NEED FOR THE FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION CENTER'S (FVPC) DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM (DIVERT) COLLABORATION TO STRENGTHEN VICTIM'S SERVICE PROGRAMS AND IMPROVE VICTIM SERVICE DELIVERY (VAWA FEDERAL PURPOSE AREA 5). DIVERT'S DAILY ACTIVITIES ARE TO RESPOND IN PERSON OR OVER THE PHONE TO DV VICTIMS AND OFFER EMOTIONAL AND SERVICE SUPPORT TO THE MOST RECENT CRISIS AND TO EXPLORE WITH THE VICTIMS THE CONTEXTUAL EXPERIENCES OF THE DV VICTIMIZATION.

 THERE IS INTENSIVE FREIGHT MOVEMENT THROUGH THE REGION 6 STATES FERRYING GOODS TO THE CITIES AND RURAL
 COMMUNITIES THEREIN. WHILE MUCH ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE COASTAL PORTS, THERE IS INADEQUATE ATTENTION
 TO INLAND PORTS. INLAND PORTS MAY BE RIVER BASED AS IN THE LARGEST INLAND INTERNATIONAL SEAPORT IN THE
 UNITED STATES, PORT OF CATOOSA IN TULSA. OKLAHOMA. THIS PORT SHIPS MORE THAN 2 MILLION TONS OF CARGO
 ANNUALLY ON BARGES ON THE MCCLELLAN-KERR ARKANSAS RIVER NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.
 ARKANSAS, ALSO, HAS SEVERAL INLAND PORTS. BEYOND THE WATERWAYS, INLAND PORTS ALSO PROVIDE INTERMODAL
 TRANSITION FOR RAILROADS AND TRUCKING OPERATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, THE INLAND PORT OF DALLAS FOCUSES ON
 RAILROAD AND TRUCKING CONNECTIONS. NEW MEXICO'S INLAND PORTS AND SOME IN TEXAS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH
 INTERNATIONAL BORDERS. THE LOCATIONS OF THESE PORTS ARE SOMETIMES PROXIMATE TO COMMUNITIES AND
 NEIGHBORHOODS THAT BEAR A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH INLAND PORTS.
 PROXIMITY MAY INCREASE NOISE LEVELS, TRAFFIC AND MOBILITY, AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY INFLUENCING PROPERTY
 VALUES. ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, NUMEROUS JOB OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE JOB BASE.
 QUESTIONS OF EQUITY AND VULNERABILITY ARE SUITABLE FOR RESEARCH. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH WILL BE TO
 IDENTIFY TO RELEVANT VARIABLES FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES PROXIMATE TO INLAND PORTS, TO ITERATE POSITIVE
 VARIABLES AND DELINEATE MITIGATION STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES.
 RESEARCH IDEA 2
 THE POPULARITY OF BICYCLES AS A FORM OF TRANSPORTATION IS GROWING AROUND THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY IN
 URBAN AREAS. MANY RESEARCH WORKS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF BICYCLES IN REDUCING TRAFFIC
 CONGESTION AND IMPROVING AIR CONDITION. ROADWAY CONSTRUCTION SHOULD MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL ROAD
 USERS, INCLUDING CYCLISTS. HOWEVER, MANY EXISTING ROADWAYS DID NOT PLAN BICYCLE FACILITIES WHEN
 INITIALLY DESIGNED. WITH THE INCREASED NUMBER OF CYCLISTS, ADDING DESIGNATED BIKE LANES IS NECESSARY.
 WHEN PHYSICALLY WIDENING THE ROADWAY IS NOT FEASIBLE, THE COMMON METHODS TO ADD BIKE LANES ARE
 UTILIZING SHOULDERS, CURBS, REDUCING THE WIDTH OF EXISTING TRAVEL LANES OR PARKING LANES, OR REDUCING
 THE NUMBER OF TRAVEL LANES OR PARKING LANES.
 MANY CITIES HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED CONSTRUCTIONS TO ADDED BIKE LANES. HOWEVER, THE SAFETY
 IMPACTS OF ADDING BIKE LANES HAVEN'T BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED. ACCORDING TO THE
 CLEARING HOUSE, CRASH MODIFICATION FACTORS DEVELOPED FOR INSTALLING BICYCLE LANES WERE MIXED
 RESULTS, AND MOST OF THEM WERE DEVELOPED BASED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF SAMPLES. THEREFORE, MORE
 STUDIES ARE NEEDED.
 IN HOUSTON, NEARLY 1,800 MILES OF HIGH-COMFORT BIKEWAYS WERE PLANNED IN 2020. MANY CONSTRUCTIONS
 HAVE BEEN COMPLETED IN 2021 OR MORE RECENTLY, WHICH PROVIDES US RESOURCES TO PERFORM SAFETY
 ANALYSIS ON THE NEWLY ADDED BIKE LANES. THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO ANALYZE THE
 SAFETY IMPACTS OF DIFFERENT METHODS OF ADDING BIKE LANES BY CONDUCTING CASE STUDIES AT SELECTED SITES
 IN HOUSTON, TEXAS.
 NOTE THAT, TO ADD BIKE LANES, THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SOME ROADWAYS WILL NOT ONLY ACCOMMODATE
 CYCLISTS BUT ALSO WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND THE OPERATION OF THE WHOLE
 ROADWAY NETWORK. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH COULD PROVIDE A REFERENCE FOR CITIES IN REGION 6 WHEN
 PLANNING TO ADD BIKE LANES.

 SCOPE OF WORK Ã‚   PROJECT 2
 PATIENTS WITH AGGRESSIVE ENDOMETRIAL CANCER HISTOLOGIES HAVE A POOR PROGNOSIS. FOR EXAMPLE, UTERINE SEROUS
 CANCER (USC) ACCOUNTS FOR 40% OF ENDOMETRIAL CANCER DEATHS. ALTHOUGH 10-20% OF ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
 PATIENTS HAVE AN INITIAL DIAGNOSIS OF USC OR GRADE 3 ENDOMETRIOID ENDOMETRIAL CANCER (G3 EEC), WOMEN WITH
 THESE SUBTYPES ARE LIKELY TO RELAPSE. THESE PATIENTS MAKE UP A DISPROPORTIONATE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS UNDER
 ACTIVE TREATMENT, AND THE MAJORITY WILL DIE OF THIS DISEASE. THUS, WE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW TARGETED TREATMENT
 OPTIONS FOR THESE DEADLY FORMS OF ENDOMETRIAL CANCER. WE ARE ADDRESSING THIS NEED BY FOCUSING ON THE RECEPTOR
 TYROSINE KINASE AXL FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST, WE PUBLISHED THAT, WHEREAS LOW-GRADE ENDOMETRIAL TUMORS HAD
 LOW AXL PROTEIN EXPRESSION, 71% OF TUMOR SAMPLES FROM PATIENTS WITH USC AND G3 EEC HIGHLY EXPRESSED AXL
 PROTEIN BY IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC). SECOND, THIS HIGH AXL EXPRESSION CORRELATED WITH CHEMOTHERAPY
 RESISTANCE AND POOR SURVIVAL1, 2
 . THIRD, WE FOUND THAT AXL BINDING TO ITS ONLY LIGAND, GROWTH ARREST SPECIFIC GENE6 (GAS6), INDUCES PROLIFERATION, SURVIVAL, INVASION, METASTASIS, AVOIDANCE OF APOPTOSIS, AND ANGIOGENESIS IN
 MULTIPLE TUMOR TYPES INCLUDING USC1-4
 . FOURTH, WE FOUND THAT INHIBITING AXL IMPROVED SENSITIVITY TO PACLITAXEL,
 LEADING TO DECREASED CANCER CELL SURVIVAL AND DECREASED TUMOR BURDEN IN A MOUSE MODEL OF ENDOMETRIAL
 CANCER2
 .
 HERE, OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO BEGIN TRANSLATING OUR FINDINGS TO CLINICAL CARE AND DEVELOPING NEW COMBINATION
 THERAPIES BY TESTING THE GAS6/AXL INHIBITOR AVB-500 (NOW NAMED BATIRAXCEPT). THIS FUSION PROTEIN SEQUESTERS
 GAS6 BY BINDING WITH EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH AFFINITY, AND WE HAVE STRONG PUBLISHED PRECLINICAL DATA THAT IT IS
 EFFECTIVE AGAINST USC. THUS, WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS THAT INHIBITING GAS6/AXL WITH
 BATIRAXCEPT WILL IMPROVE RESPONSE TO STANDARD-OF-CARE TREATMENT FOR RECURRENT ENDOMETRIAL CANCER WITH
 AGGRESSIVE HISTOLOGIES. TO DO SO, WE WILL PURSUE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS:
 AIM 1: DETERMINE THE SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY OF COMBINING BATIRAXCEPT WITH STANDARD-OF-CARE PACLITAXEL
 IN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT, AGGRESSIVE ENDOMETRIAL CANCER HISTOLOGIES (USC AND G3 EEC).
 WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE COMBINATION OF BATIRAXCEPT PLUS PACLITAXEL WILL BE SAFE AND TOLERABLE IN PATIENTS WITH
 RECURRENT ENDOMETRIAL CANCER. WE WILL WORK WITH OUR SPORE ENDOMETRIAL CANCER EQUITY GROUP TO RECRUIT
 DIVERSE PATIENTS TO THIS PHASE I/IB CLINICAL TRIAL. THE DOSE ESCALATION PHASE WILL INCLUDE 6Ã‚  12 PATIENTS, AND THE
 DOSE EXPANSION PHASE WILL INCLUDE 24 PATIENTS. OUR PRIMARY OUTCOME WILL BE SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY. OUR
 SECONDARY OUTCOMES WILL BE OBJECTIVE RESPONSE RATE AND CORRELATION OF RESPONSE WITH PRE-TREATMENT GAS6/AXL
 EXPRESSION IN TUMOR BIOPSIES, SOLUBLE AXL:GAS6 RATIO IN SERUM, TISSUE PHARMACODYNAMICS, AND BLOOD
 PHARMACOKINETICS.
 EXPLORATORY AIM 2: IDENTIFY TISSUE AND BLOOD MARKERS THAT CORRELATE WITH RESPONSE TO TREATMENT.
 WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT GLYCOLYTICALLY ACTIVE TUMORS WILL RESPOND BETTER TO BATIRAXCEPT AND PACLITAXEL THAN NONGLYCOLYTICALLY ACTIVE TUMORS, AND THAT ON-TREATMENT BIOPSIES OF RESPONDERS WILL HAVE A GREATER DECREASE IN
 GLYCOLYTIC INTERMEDIATES THAN POOR RESPONDERS. THIS IDEA IS FOUNDED ON EVIDENCE THAT AXL REGULATES ACTIVITY OF
 PI3K/AKT, WHICH PARTICIPATES IN GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR WORK, AS WELL AS OTHERS' WORK IN LUNG
 CANCER, DEMONSTRATED THAT HIGH AXL EXPRESSION IS ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHLY GLYCOLYTIC PHENOTYPE. MOREOVER,
 AXL INHIBITION PLUS PACLITAXEL LEADS TO A DECREASE IN GLYCOLYTIC INTERMEDIATES5,6. WE WILL TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS BY
 PERFORMING STABLE ISOTOPE TRACING IN 8 PATIENTS ENROLLED IN THE TRIAL IN AIM 1. THIS AIM WILL LEVERAGE THE UNIQUE
 EXPERTISE OF THE SPORE BIOSPECIMENS, METABOLOMICS, AND PATHOLOGY CORE.
 AIM 3: DETERMINE THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH BATIRAXCEPT IMPROVES RESPONSE TO THE STANDARD-OF-CARE
 ANTI-ANGIOGENIC BEVACIZUMAB.
 AXL CAN REGULATE ACTIVITY OF VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR, WHICH CAN BE INHIBITED WITH THE MONOCLONAL
 ANTIBODY THERAPY BEVACIZUMAB. FURTHERMORE, IN PRELIMINARY IN VITRO AND IN VIVO DATA, WE SHOW THAT BATIRAXCEPT
 ACTS WITH BEVACIZUMAB TO REDUCE BLOOD VESSEL DENSITY AND FORMATION. THUS, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT BATIRAXCEPT-
 TREATED TUMOR CELLS HAVE DECREASED ABILITY TO PROMOTE ANGIOGENESIS. WE WILL TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS IN ORTHOTOPIC
 PATIENT-DERIVED XENOGRAFT MOUSE MODELS DEVELOPED FROM TREATMENT-RESISTANT TUMORS.

 BACKGROUND: THE FEED THE FUTURE INNOVATION LAB FOR HORTICULTURE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS (UC DAVIS) WILL IMPLEMENT RESEARCH PROJECTS IN THE HORTICULTURE SECTOR IN FOUR DIFFERENT REGIONS Ã‚   EAST AFRICA, WEST AFRICA, SOUTH/SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND CENTRAL AMERICA. THE RESEARCH WILL START IN MARCH 2023 AND END IN SEPTEMBER 2026. PROJECTS WILL BE MARKET-ORIENTED, WITH ADDITIONAL FOCUS ON GENDER EQUITY, YOUTH ENGAGEMENT, AND NUTRITION. THE PROJECTS WILL BE LED BY LOCAL EXPERTS AND ORGANIZATIONS, WITH SUPPORT FROM THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LABÃ‚  S MANAGEMENT ENTITY AND ITS CONSORTIUM Ã‚   FLORIDA AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL UNIVERSITY, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY, TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY, AND THE WORLD VEGETABLE CENTER Ã‚   AND SPECIALISTS IN GENDER, YOUTH, AND NUTRITION. TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THESE RESEARCH PROJECTS, THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB WILL ESTABLISH FOUR REGIONAL HUBS Ã‚   ONE PER REGION Ã‚   THAT WILL HOST A REGIONAL HUB MANAGER. THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL OPERATE ON-THE-GROUND AS PROGRAM COORDINATORS, NETWORKERS, MONITORS, EVALUATORS, AND DISSEMINATORS OF INFORMATION.
 THE OBJECTIVES OF THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB ARE: 
 Ã‚ Â¢OBJECTIVE 1: DEVELOP CAPACITY OF LOCAL NETWORKS TO EQUITABLY RESPOND TO REGIONAL NEEDS
 Ã‚ Â¢OBJECTIVE 2: SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESILIENT HORTICULTURAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
 Ã‚ Â¢OBJECTIVE 3: SUPPORT INCLUSIVE, SUSTAINABLE HORTICULTURAL ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION WITHIN SMALLHOLDER SYSTEMS
 Ã‚ Â¢OBJECTIVE 4: PROMOTE A WELL-NOURISHED POPULATION THROUGH AVAILABILITY, ACCESS AND CONSUMPTION OF SAFE, NUTRITIOUS HORTICULTURAL CROPS 
 Ã‚ Â¢OBJECTIVE 5: FACILITATE THE EXCHANGE OF INNOVATIVE IDEAS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO CONTRIBUTE TO PRACTICAL AND ACADEMIC HORTICULTURAL PURSUITS.
 
 TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB WILL IMPLEMENT THREE TYPES OF RESEARCH PROJECTS. THE FIRST ARE MARKET ORIENTED RESEARCH FOR EMPOWERMENT (MORE) PROJECTS; ONE SET IN EACH REGION. THE SECOND ARE CRITICAL ENGAGEMENT PROJECTS THAT ARE TARGETED, SHORTER IN DURATION, AND MEANT TO FOCUS ON ACUTE RESEARCH NEEDS THAT CAN INFORM THE MORE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. FINALLY, THERE IS A HIGHER-EDUCATION CAPACITY BUILDING RESEARCH PROJECT CALLED THE TRELLIS FELLOWSHIP FUND, THAT WILL LINK U.S.-BASED GRADUATE STUDENTS AND IN-COUNTRY GRADUATE STUDENTS TO TOGETHER IN ORDER TO CONDUCT SMALL-SCALE RESEARCH PROJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE PROJECT ACTIVITIES. 
 
 REGIONAL HUBS: THE REGIONAL HUBS WILL PRIMARILY SERVE AS A HOST FOR THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER BOTH IN TERMS OF PROVIDING AN OFFICE SPACE AND AS EMPLOYER OF THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER. FORWARD NEPAL WILL SERVE AS THE REGIONAL HUB FOR SOUTH ASIA. REGIONAL HUBS, AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL, SHOULD BE GEOGRAPHICALLY AND OPERATIONALLY ESTABLISHED IN A WAY THAT FACILITATES THE NETWORKING CAPACITY OF THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER. POTENTIALLY, REGIONAL HUBS WILL BE LOCATIONS WHERE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB PROGRAM STAKEHOLDERS CONVENE FOR MEETINGS, BUT THIS CAPACITY IS NOT A NECESSITY. FOR FACILITATING THIS ROLE IN SOUTH ASIA, THE REGIONAL HUB WILL BE BASED IN KATHMANDU, NEPAL.
 REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS:  IN EACH REGIONAL HUB, THERE WILL BE A REGIONAL HUB MANAGER THAT WILL BECOME AN EMPLOYEE OF THE REGIONAL HUB, BUT ALSO BE CONSIDERED A PART OF THE MANAGEMENT ENTITY OF THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB. MR. KRISHNA PRASAD SAPKOTA HAS BEEN ASSIGNED AS THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER FOR SOUTH ASIA. MR SAPKOTA WILL LIVE IN-COUNTRY (NEPAL) AND COORDINATE AND MONITOR PROJECTS AND TRAININGS, INTRODUCE AND ADVOCATE FOR NEW INNOVATIONS, AS WELL AS CULTIVATE IN-COUNTRY NETWORKS INCLUDING USAID MISSION RELATIONSHIPS. ACROSS ALL REGIONS, THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL BE TASKED AND SUPPORTED TO NOT ONLY ENGAGE IN THE FIELD WITH IMPLEMENTERS, BUT ALSO TO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS OR END-USERS TO COLLECT INSIGHTS INTO THE EFFECTIVENESS AND PROGRESS OF RESEARCH. ULTIMATELY, THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL BE THE ON-THE-GROUND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB. 
 PROJECT MONITORING: MR. SAPKOTA WILL COORDINATE WITH HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB PROJECTS IN THE REGION TO ASSIST THE MANAGEMENT ENTITY IN TRACKING THEIR RESEARCH PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING PROGRAM AND PROJECT OBJECTIVES. THIS COORDINATION INCLUDES ASSISTING RESEARCH PROJECTS TO ADAPT IN ORDER TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES OR ADDRESS HIGH PRIORITY OPPORTUNITIES. PROJECT MONITORING FOR THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER ADDITIONALLY INVOLVES HELPING PROJECTS REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH USAID GUIDELINES AND THE NEED TO SUBMIT REQUIRED DATA, REPORTS, AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT, AS NEEDED, BY BOTH USAID AND UC DAVIS. FINALLY, THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER WILL SUPPORT PROJECT CAPACITY TO CONDUCT RIGOROUS RESEARCH.
 COMMUNICATION: THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL CONSISTENTLY CONNECT THE CONSORTIUM WITH A NETWORK OF LOCAL EXPERTS, LEADERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS. THE PURPOSES OF THIS NETWORKING INCLUDE: TO GATHER GUIDANCE ON THE DOWNSTREAM NEEDS OF STAKEHOLDERS AND END-USERS OF INNOVATION; TO BROADLY SHARE RESULTS AND INFORMATION FROM RESEARCH PROJECTS; AND TO FACILITATE COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN KEY ACTORS IN THE REGIONAL RESEARCH PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY, THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER WILL ROUTINELY COMMUNICATE WITH USAID MISSIONS IN THE REGION TO UPDATE THEM ON PROGRESS AND TO LEARN ABOUT FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB COULD PURSUE. 
 THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER WILL MAINTAIN ROUTINE COMMUNICATION WITH UC DAVIS, AND THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB CONSORTIUM AND SPECIALISTS. AS PART OF THIS EXPECTATION FOR COMMUNICATION, THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER WILL PROVIDE FREQUENT UPDATES REGARDING RESEARCH PROGRESS TOWARD PROJECT MILESTONES. 
 REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL SUPPORT UC DAVIS AND PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS IN THE REGION WITH DRAFTING NECESSARY USAID REPORTS (SEMI-ANNUAL AND ANNUAL REPORTS) AND INFORMATION DELIVERABLES SUCH AS EXTENSION BULLETINS AND TRAINING MANUALS. REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL ALSO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE DISSEMINATION OF THESE INFORMATION DELIVERABLES TO INTERMEDIARY ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER STAKEHOLDERS. 
 REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS TO GATHER LESSONS LEARNED FROM PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND SHARE INFORMATION/RESULTS THAT COULD BE APPLICABLE FOR OTHER REGIONS WHERE THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB IS OPERATING. 
 IMPLEMENTATION OF MANAGEMENT ENTITY ACTIVITIES: TANGENTIAL TO THE RESEARCH PROJECT ACTIVITIES LED BY LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AND EXPERTS, THE MANAGEMENT ENTITY FOR THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB WILL HAVE ACTIVITIES THAT WILL BOTH BENEFIT FROM INPUT FROM LOCAL EXPERTISE AT THE REGIONAL HUB AND WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON-THE-GROUND BY REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS. AS AN EXAMPLE, THESE ACTIVITIES COULD INCLUDE THE BUILDING OF WEB-BASED TOOLS FOR RESEARCHERS AND STAKEHOLDERS IN THE HORTICULTURE SECTOR. SPECIFICALLY, INFORMATIONAL VIDEOS COULD BE PRODUCED AND MATERIALS REFINED TO BE APPLICABLE TO LOCAL CULTURAL CONDITIONS. ESSENTIALLY, THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER, AS PART OF THE MANAGEMENT ENTITY, WILL BE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE AND LEAD IN ACTIVITIES THAT HELP THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES",assistance_sub,10/16/2023,10/16/2023,0,Single Action,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Small ($10K - $100K),1,6

THE FLOOD RISKS AND THEIR IMPACTS ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND LIVELIHOODS SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION MOBILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY WILL BE ASSESSED WITH A FOCUS ON SOCIAL EQUITY; FOR EXAMPLE, LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN HIGH-RISK ZONES, FACE HIGHER DAMAGES, AND ARE LESS ABLE TO RECOVER. THE PROJECT WILL USE A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACTS AT TWO SCALES: (1) MACROSCOPIC SCALE (SUCH AS A TOWN OR CITY) USING GEOAI TOOLS, AND (2) MICROSCOPIC SCALE (SUCH AS A CENSUS TRACT) USING DIGITAL TWIN MODEL. GEOAI TOOLS INTEGRATE GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS WITH MACHINE LEARNING METHODS. IN THIS PROJECT, THE TOOL WILL INTEGRATE TIME-SERIES-BASED TRAFFIC, PRECIPITATION, AND HYDROLOGY DATA WITH THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATASETS ON MOBILITY AND DISADVANTAGE INDICES. THE CITY OF GREENSBORO IN NORTH CAROLINA WILL BE USED AS A TESTBED FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE GEOAI TOOL.

 PARTNERSHIPS IN SCHOOL MEAL IMPLEMENTATION
 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE: DISPARITIES IN CHILDHOOD OBESITY HAVE INCREASED SINCE THE COVID-19
 PANDEMIC, ESPECIALLY FOR ADOLESCENTS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX, COMMUNITY AND POPULATION-LEVEL FACTORS
 THAT INFLUENCE HEALTH OUTCOMES (I.E., POVERTY, DISCRIMINATION, INADEQUATE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD),
 POLICY, SYSTEMS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL APPROACHES ARE NECESSARY TO MITIGATE OBESITY RISK AND ACHIEVE
 EQUITABLE OUTCOMES FOR MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS SUCH AS AND RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES AND THOSE WITH
 LOW-INCOME. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT PROVIDING HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER QUALITY
 NUTRITIONAL INTAKE AND REDUCED OBESITY PREVALENCE, ESPECIALLY IN LOW-INCOME STUDENTS. THUS, INCREASING
 ACCESS TO HEALTHY MEALS AT SCHOOL IS A CRITICAL STEP TO MITIGATING DISPARITIES IN OBESITY PREVALENCE IN
 YOUTH. UNIVERSAL FREE SCHOOL MEALS (USM) ADOPTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH QUALITY OF DIETARY INTAKE, FOOD
 SECURITY, AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OUTCOMES OBSERVED THROUGH RANDOMIZED TRIALS AND LONGITUDINAL
 STUDIES. THEREFORE, USM IS A KEY PSE APPROACH FOR EQUITABLE OBESITY PREVENTION. HOWEVER, UPTAKE OF
 SCHOOL MEALS IS LOW DESPITE BEING PROVIDED AT NO COST; TO DATE THERE IS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHY
 AND HOW THIS IS THE CASE, FURTHER CONTRIBUTING THIS IMPLEMENTATION GAP.
 A KEY ISSUE WHICH NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IS A LACK OF REPRESENTATION FROM END-USERS AND IMPLEMENTERS
 WHO HAVE VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE, SUCH AS STUDENTS, CAREGIVERS, TEACHERS, LEADERSHIP, AND
 COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCE IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED BY RESEARCHERS, WHICH MAY CAUSE
 MISTRUST IN THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND DISENFRANCHISEMENT. MOST EVALUATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED
 TO UNDERSTAND PERSPECTIVES OF THOSE WHO ENGAGE WITH CABS, BUT NOT THE MEMBERS THEMSELVES. THUS,
 THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE:
 1) TO EVALUATE THE ACCEPTABILITY, APPROPRIATENESS, AND FEASIBILITY OF RECRUITING A CAB WHICH REFLECTS
 THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OF PHILADELPHIA (SDP) AND
 SURROUNDING COMMUNITY; AND
 2) TO ASSESS DETERMINANTS OF THESE OUTCOMES THROUGH A HEALTH EQUITY LENS USING MIXED METHODS
 METHODS: THE CAB WILL BE RECRUITED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2023; WE AIM TO RECRUIT 8-10 MEMBERS FROM EACH
 PARTICIPANT GROUP DESCRIBED ABOVE. THIS RECRUITMENT WILL TAKE PLACE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE SDP AS IT
 DIRECTLY ALIGNS WITH THEIR STRATEGIC MISSION. THIS CAB WILL MEET THREE TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF ONE
 CALENDAR YEAR TO ENGAGE WITH THE RESEARCH TEAM ON THE DESIGN OF THE STUDY IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING
 WITH ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF INITIAL FINDINGS.
 THE PRIMARY EVALUATION DATA COLLECTION TOOL WILL BE A SURVEY ADMINISTERED AT TWO TIME POINTS (FALL 2023
 AND SPRING 2024). THIS SURVEY WILL REPLICATE ONE OF FEW EXAMPLES OF AN EVALUATION OF CAB MEMBERSÃ‚  
 PERSPECTIVES. SPECIFICALLY, THE AUTHORS IN THIS STUDY CO-DEVELOPED A SURVEY WITH CAB MEMBERS WHICH
 ASSESSED FIVE DOMAINS: MISSION, COMMITMENT, COMMUNICATION, RESPECT/TRUST, AND TEAMWORK/
 BALANCE OF POWER. EACH DOMAIN HAS SEVERAL ITEMS AND ITEMS ARE SCORED USING A LIKERT-SCALE
 RESPONSE (I.E., STRONGLY DISAGREE-STRONGLY AGREE). IT ALSO INCORPORATED FREE-RESPONSE ITEMS SUCH AS
 Ã‚  WHY DID YOU INITIALLY JOIN THE CAB?Ã‚   AND Ã‚  WHAT ARE 3 WAYS THE CAB COULD IMPROVE OVER THE NEXT 6
 MONTHS?Ã‚  . MEETINGS WILL ALSO BE RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED TO PROVIDE RICH CONTEXTUAL DATA ON DISCUSSION
 TOPICS AND BARRIERS/FACILITATORS TO ENGAGING MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHICH MAY NOT BE OTHERWISE
 GATHERED THROUGH FORMAL DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES. DATA WILL BE ANALYZED THROUGH DESCRIPTIVE (LIKERT
 SCALE) AND INDUCTIVE QUALITATIVE (FREE RESPONSE, MEETING NOTES) METHODS TO BEST ANSWER THE STUDY AIMS
 AND PROVIDE RICH UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAB FORMATION.
 IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO UNDERTAKE AN EVALUATION OF CAB DEVELOPMENT THROUGH A
 HEALTH EQUITY LENS. FINDINGS WILL BE USED TO REFINE THE CAB OVER TIME AND MAY HELP OTHER RESEARCHERS
 NAVIGATE THIS PRACTICE IN A WAY THAT IS RESPECTFUL AND AVOIDS SUPERFICIAL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN

 PARTNERSHIPS IN SCHOOL MEAL IMPLEMENTATION
 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE: DISPARITIES IN CHILDHOOD OBESITY HAVE INCREASED SINCE THE COVID-19
 PANDEMIC, ESPECIALLY FOR ADOLESCENTS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX, COMMUNITY AND POPULATION-LEVEL FACTORS
 THAT INFLUENCE HEALTH OUTCOMES (I.E., POVERTY, DISCRIMINATION, INADEQUATE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD),
 POLICY, SYSTEMS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL APPROACHES ARE NECESSARY TO MITIGATE OBESITY RISK AND ACHIEVE
 EQUITABLE OUTCOMES FOR MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS SUCH AS AND RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES AND THOSE WITH
 LOW-INCOME. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT PROVIDING HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER QUALITY
 NUTRITIONAL INTAKE AND REDUCED OBESITY PREVALENCE, ESPECIALLY IN LOW-INCOME STUDENTS. THUS, INCREASING
 ACCESS TO HEALTHY MEALS AT SCHOOL IS A CRITICAL STEP TO MITIGATING DISPARITIES IN OBESITY PREVALENCE IN
 YOUTH. UNIVERSAL FREE SCHOOL MEALS (USM) ADOPTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH QUALITY OF DIETARY INTAKE, FOOD
 SECURITY, AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OUTCOMES OBSERVED THROUGH RANDOMIZED TRIALS AND LONGITUDINAL
 STUDIES. THEREFORE, USM IS A KEY PSE APPROACH FOR EQUITABLE OBESITY PREVENTION. HOWEVER, UPTAKE OF
 SCHOOL MEALS IS LOW DESPITE BEING PROVIDED AT NO COST; TO DATE THERE IS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHY
 AND HOW THIS IS THE CASE, FURTHER CONTRIBUTING THIS IMPLEMENTATION GAP.
 A KEY ISSUE WHICH NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IS A LACK OF REPRESENTATION FROM END-USERS AND IMPLEMENTERS
 WHO HAVE VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE, SUCH AS STUDENTS, CAREGIVERS, TEACHERS, LEADERSHIP, AND
 COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCE IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED BY RESEARCHERS, WHICH MAY CAUSE
 MISTRUST IN THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND DISENFRANCHISEMENT. MOST EVALUATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED
 TO UNDERSTAND PERSPECTIVES OF THOSE WHO ENGAGE WITH CABS, BUT NOT THE MEMBERS THEMSELVES. THUS,
 THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE:
 1) TO EVALUATE THE ACCEPTABILITY, APPROPRIATENESS, AND FEASIBILITY OF RECRUITING A CAB WHICH REFLECTS
 THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OF PHILADELPHIA (SDP) AND
 SURROUNDING COMMUNITY; AND
 2) TO ASSESS DETERMINANTS OF THESE OUTCOMES THROUGH A HEALTH EQUITY LENS USING MIXED METHODS
 METHODS: THE CAB WILL BE RECRUITED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2023; WE AIM TO RECRUIT 8-10 MEMBERS FROM EACH
 PARTICIPANT GROUP DESCRIBED ABOVE. THIS RECRUITMENT WILL TAKE PLACE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE SDP AS IT
 DIRECTLY ALIGNS WITH THEIR STRATEGIC MISSION. THIS CAB WILL MEET THREE TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF ONE
 CALENDAR YEAR TO ENGAGE WITH THE RESEARCH TEAM ON THE DESIGN OF THE STUDY IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING
 WITH ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF INITIAL FINDINGS.
 THE PRIMARY EVALUATION DATA COLLECTION TOOL WILL BE A SURVEY ADMINISTERED AT TWO TIME POINTS (FALL 2023
 AND SPRING 2024). THIS SURVEY WILL REPLICATE ONE OF FEW EXAMPLES OF AN EVALUATION OF CAB MEMBERSÃ‚  
 PERSPECTIVES. SPECIFICALLY, THE AUTHORS IN THIS STUDY CO-DEVELOPED A SURVEY WITH CAB MEMBERS WHICH
 ASSESSED FIVE DOMAINS: MISSION, COMMITMENT, COMMUNICATION, RESPECT/TRUST, AND TEAMWORK/
 BALANCE OF POWER. EACH DOMAIN HAS SEVERAL ITEMS AND ITEMS ARE SCORED USING A LIKERT-SCALE
 RESPONSE (I.E., STRONGLY DISAGREE-STRONGLY AGREE). IT ALSO INCORPORATED FREE-RESPONSE ITEMS SUCH AS
 Ã‚  WHY DID YOU INITIALLY JOIN THE CAB?Ã‚   AND Ã‚  WHAT ARE 3 WAYS THE CAB COULD IMPROVE OVER THE NEXT 6
 MONTHS?Ã‚  . MEETINGS WILL ALSO BE RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED TO PROVIDE RICH CONTEXTUAL DATA ON DISCUSSION
 TOPICS AND BARRIERS/FACILITATORS TO ENGAGING MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHICH MAY NOT BE OTHERWISE
 GATHERED THROUGH FORMAL DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES. DATA WILL BE ANALYZED THROUGH DESCRIPTIVE (LIKERT
 SCALE) AND INDUCTIVE QUALITATIVE (FREE RESPONSE, MEETING NOTES) METHODS TO BEST ANSWER THE STUDY AIMS
 AND PROVIDE RICH UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAB FORMATION.
 IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO UNDERTAKE AN EVALUATION OF CAB DEVELOPMENT THROUGH A
 HEALTH EQUITY LENS. FINDINGS WILL BE USED TO REFINE THE CAB OVER TIME AND MAY HELP OTHER RESEARCHERS
 NAVIGATE THIS PRACTICE IN A WAY THAT IS RESPECTFUL AND AVOIDS SUPERFICIAL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN

 (BOYCE, 2017; GREENE, DESTEFANO, BURGON, & HALL, 2006). THE VEE APPROACH, DEVELOPED WITH NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION  EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES SUPPORT, DEFINES HIGH-QUALITY STEM EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING AS THAT WHICH EFFECTIVELY INCORPORATES CUTTINGEDGE SCIENTIFIC CONTENT, STRONG INSTRUCTIONAL PEDAGOGY, AND SENSITIVITY TO DIVERSITY AND EQUITY ISSUES. THE VEE EVALUATION APPROACH ENCOURAGES EXPLICIT ATTENTION TO ISSUES OF DIVERSITY
 AND EQUITY, AND RESPONSIVENESS TO THE CULTURE AND CONTEXT OF THE PROGRAM. SPECIFICALLY, THE EVALUATOR IS CALLED TO EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH AN EDUCATION PROGRAM IS EQUITABLE OR HAS EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTICIPATION, MEANINGFUL LEARNING, AND ACCOMPLISHMENT, PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE LEAST WELL SERVED IN THAT CONTEXT. ADDITIONALLY, THIS APPROACH SEEKS TO EDUCATE STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THEIR PROGRAM WHILE ALSO ENGAGING THE PERSPECTIVES, CONCERNS, AND VALUES OF ALL LEGITIMATE STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING THOSE TRADITIONALLY UNHEARD AND
 UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE EVALUATION CONTEXT.
 
 THE EVALUATION TEAM WILL UTILIZE A MIXED-METHODS STRATEGY IN WHICH DATA FROM ONE TYPE OF METHOD (QUANTITATIVE OR QUALITATIVE) IS MERGED, CONNECTED, AND/OR EMBEDDED WITH DATA FROM ANOTHER TYPE OF METHOD. MIXED-METHODS EVALUATIONS PROVIDE RICHER DATA ALLOW FOR BETTER

 PARTNERSHIPS IN SCHOOL MEAL IMPLEMENTATION
 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE: DISPARITIES IN CHILDHOOD OBESITY HAVE INCREASED SINCE THE COVID-19
 PANDEMIC, ESPECIALLY FOR ADOLESCENTS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX, COMMUNITY AND POPULATION-LEVEL FACTORS
 THAT INFLUENCE HEALTH OUTCOMES (I.E., POVERTY, DISCRIMINATION, INADEQUATE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD),
 POLICY, SYSTEMS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL APPROACHES ARE NECESSARY TO MITIGATE OBESITY RISK AND ACHIEVE
 EQUITABLE OUTCOMES FOR MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS SUCH AS AND RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES AND THOSE WITH
 LOW-INCOME. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT PROVIDING HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER QUALITY
 NUTRITIONAL INTAKE AND REDUCED OBESITY PREVALENCE, ESPECIALLY IN LOW-INCOME STUDENTS. THUS, INCREASING
 ACCESS TO HEALTHY MEALS AT SCHOOL IS A CRITICAL STEP TO MITIGATING DISPARITIES IN OBESITY PREVALENCE IN
 YOUTH. UNIVERSAL FREE SCHOOL MEALS (USM) ADOPTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH QUALITY OF DIETARY INTAKE, FOOD
 SECURITY, AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OUTCOMES OBSERVED THROUGH RANDOMIZED TRIALS AND LONGITUDINAL
 STUDIES. THEREFORE, USM IS A KEY PSE APPROACH FOR EQUITABLE OBESITY PREVENTION. HOWEVER, UPTAKE OF
 SCHOOL MEALS IS LOW DESPITE BEING PROVIDED AT NO COST; TO DATE THERE IS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHY
 AND HOW THIS IS THE CASE, FURTHER CONTRIBUTING THIS IMPLEMENTATION GAP.
 A KEY ISSUE WHICH NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IS A LACK OF REPRESENTATION FROM END-USERS AND IMPLEMENTERS
 WHO HAVE VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE, SUCH AS STUDENTS, CAREGIVERS, TEACHERS, LEADERSHIP, AND
 COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCE IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED BY RESEARCHERS, WHICH MAY CAUSE
 MISTRUST IN THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND DISENFRANCHISEMENT. MOST EVALUATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED
 TO UNDERSTAND PERSPECTIVES OF THOSE WHO ENGAGE WITH CABS, BUT NOT THE MEMBERS THEMSELVES. THUS,
 THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE:
 1) TO EVALUATE THE ACCEPTABILITY, APPROPRIATENESS, AND FEASIBILITY OF RECRUITING A CAB WHICH REFLECTS
 THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OF PHILADELPHIA (SDP) AND
 SURROUNDING COMMUNITY; AND
 2) TO ASSESS DETERMINANTS OF THESE OUTCOMES THROUGH A HEALTH EQUITY LENS USING MIXED METHODS
 METHODS: THE CAB WILL BE RECRUITED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2023; WE AIM TO RECRUIT 8-10 MEMBERS FROM EACH
 PARTICIPANT GROUP DESCRIBED ABOVE. THIS RECRUITMENT WILL TAKE PLACE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE SDP AS IT
 DIRECTLY ALIGNS WITH THEIR STRATEGIC MISSION. THIS CAB WILL MEET THREE TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF ONE
 CALENDAR YEAR TO ENGAGE WITH THE RESEARCH TEAM ON THE DESIGN OF THE STUDY IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING
 WITH ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF INITIAL FINDINGS.
 THE PRIMARY EVALUATION DATA COLLECTION TOOL WILL BE A SURVEY ADMINISTERED AT TWO TIME POINTS (FALL 2023
 AND SPRING 2024). THIS SURVEY WILL REPLICATE ONE OF FEW EXAMPLES OF AN EVALUATION OF CAB MEMBERSÃ‚  
 PERSPECTIVES. SPECIFICALLY, THE AUTHORS IN THIS STUDY CO-DEVELOPED A SURVEY WITH CAB MEMBERS WHICH
 ASSESSED FIVE DOMAINS: MISSION, COMMITMENT, COMMUNICATION, RESPECT/TRUST, AND TEAMWORK/
 BALANCE OF POWER. EACH DOMAIN HAS SEVERAL ITEMS AND ITEMS ARE SCORED USING A LIKERT-SCALE
 RESPONSE (I.E., STRONGLY DISAGREE-STRONGLY AGREE). IT ALSO INCORPORATED FREE-RESPONSE ITEMS SUCH AS
 Ã‚  WHY DID YOU INITIALLY JOIN THE CAB?Ã‚   AND Ã‚  WHAT ARE 3 WAYS THE CAB COULD IMPROVE OVER THE NEXT 6
 MONTHS?Ã‚  . MEETINGS WILL ALSO BE RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED TO PROVIDE RICH CONTEXTUAL DATA ON DISCUSSION

 GATHERED THROUGH FORMAL DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES. DATA WILL BE ANALYZED THROUGH DESCRIPTIVE (LIKERT
 SCALE) AND INDUCTIVE QUALITATIVE (FREE RESPONSE, MEETING NOTES) METHODS TO BEST ANSWER THE STUDY AIMS
 AND PROVIDE RICH UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAB FORMATION.
 IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO UNDERTAKE AN EVALUATION OF CAB DEVELOPMENT THROUGH A
 HEALTH EQUITY LENS. FINDINGS WILL BE USED TO REFINE THE CAB OVER TIME AND MAY HELP OTHER RESEARCHERS

THROUGH THIS FUNDING, CROSSROADS WILL PROVIDE A SPECIALIZED COURT ADVOCATE TO MEET WITH SURVIVORS AT THE COURT ON A DAILY BASIS. THE PROBLEM THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED IS THE COMPLEX LEGAL ISSUES THAT SURVIVORS EXPERIENCE DURING THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. OUR COURT ADVOCATES PROVIDE A PROTECTIVE PRESENCE AT COURT FOR SURVIVORS. THEY DELIVER INFORMATION AND ACT AS A LIAISON BETWEEN THE SURVIVORS AND THE PROSECUTORS. OUR ADVOCATES ARE TRAINED IN TRAUMA-INFORMED APPROACHES, AND SHARE THEIR KNOWLEDGE WITH SURVIVORS TO HELP THEM BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY AND WHAT THEY ARE FEELING AND HOW IT RELATES TO TRAUMA. CROSSROADS PROVIDES MANY SERVICES TO SURVIVORS TO ASSIST THEM WITH IMMEDIATE NEEDS, INCLUDING SAFETY NEEDS, WHILE EMPOWERING THEM AND ASSISTING THEM WITH SEEKING JUSTICE IN THE WAY THEY CHOOSE. WITHOUT SYSTEM ACCOUNTABILITY, BATTERERS OFTEN REPEAT THE BEHAVIOR. OUR COURT ADVOCATES INFORM SURVIVORS ABOUT THE FULL ARRAY OF LEGAL OPTIONS AVAILABLE; ASSIST IN ONGOING SAFETY PLANNING; ENABLE TIMELY, EFFECTIVE SYSTEM ACCESS, PROVIDE SUPPORT AND ACCOMPANIMENT; EXPLAIN VINE & CRIME VICTIMS' COMP FUND, ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF REPRESENTATION AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES, HENCE INCREASING VICTIMS' FEELINGS OF SAFETY, SELF-SUFFICIENCY, WELL-BEING, JUSTICE, AND EMPOWERMENT. ONE OF OUR CORE VALUES IS CONFIDENTIALITY AND WE RESPECT AND ENFORCE THE RIGHT TO CONFIDENTIALITY FOR EACH AND EVERY SURVIVOR. OUR COMMUNITY'S SPECIFIC UNDERSERVED POPULATION IS ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED SURVIVORS INCLUDING AFRICAN AMERICANS, LGBTQ+, ELDERLY, AND RURAL. THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED SURVIVORS. THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU (2020 ESTIMATES) REPORTS LIMA CITY AT 24.3% OF PERSONS IN POVERTY. THE REALITY IS POVERTY CAN GREATLY INFLUENCE AND CREATE BARRIERS FOR THE SURVIVORS AS THEY ESCAPE THE VIOLENCE. AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LGBTQ+ ARE DISTRUSTFUL OF THE ""SYSTEM"" BASED ON CULTURAL HISTORY AND PREJUDICIAL EXPERIENCES. POOR AFRICAN AMERICAN FEMALES ARE INADEQUATELY SERVED IN THE REALM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DUE TO THE CONTINUED OPPRESSION. CROSSROADS HAS IMPLEMENTED A FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT PROGRAM THAT CAN ASSIST SURVIVORS IN OBTAINING FINANCIAL STABILITY AND UTILIZING COMMUNITY RESOURCES. OUR STAFF HAS ATTENDED DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION TRAINING, POVERTY/ECONOMIC TRAINING, AND COLLABORATES WITH A VARIETY OF DIVERSE COMMUNITY RESOURCES. THIS IS A CRITICAL PROJECT SO THAT SURVIVORS FEEL THEY HAVE A VOICE, CHOICES, AND THE POWER TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THEIR LIVES. OUR COURT ADVOCATES PROVIDE SURVIVORS THAT VOICE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE SAFETY, JUSTICE, AND EMPOWERMENT. IT IS CRITICAL TO THEIR HEALING; IT IS CRITICAL TO THE COMMUNITY BY SENDING A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT A ""PRIVATE FAMILY MATTER"", BUT RATHER A CRIME THAT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE HOLD PERPETRATORS OF THE CRIME RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE AS IN ANY OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE ARREST AND CONVICTIONS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENDERS ARE STRONG DETERRENTS FOR FUTURE VIOLENT INCIDENTS. CROSSROADS, IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR PARTNER AGENCIES, ARE EQUIPPED TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE NEEDS THAT SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FACE.

 GOALS:
 Ã‚ Â¢ BUILDING A COHORT OF TRAINEES WITH KNOWLEDGE OF COMPUTATIONAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIAL SCIENCES USING INNOVATIVE, EVIDENCE-BASED, GRADUATE EDUCATION: THE PROGRAM WILL PRODUCE 49 AIACCESS TRAINEES WHO ARE TRAINED IN MODERN AI AND DATA SCIENCE PRACTICES, INCLUDING ML, INFERENTIAL STATISTICS (INCLUDING CAUSAL REASONING), THE ACQUISITION AND MANAGEMENT OF DATA, AND ETHICAL AI PRACTICES. ALL STUDENTS WHO GO THROUGH THE TRAINEESHIP SHOULD ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT DEPTH IN A SUBSTANTIVE DOMAIN THAT STUDIES HUMAN SOCIAL BEHAVIORS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. STUDENTS WILL GAIN TRANSFERRABLE PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND REAL-LIFE INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCES. THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE JUDGED IN PART BY THE POSITIONS THESE TRAINEES TAKE UPON COMPLETION OF THEIR DEGREES, AND THEIR FUTURE IMPACT ON ACADEMIA, INDUSTRY, AND SOCIETY.
 
 Ã‚ Â¢ FOSTERING AND FACILITATING NOVEL TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH: THE PROGRAM SHOULD LEAD TO NEW INTERACTIONS AMONG RESEARCH GROUPS AND AREAS AT WASHU, CATALYZED BY GRADUATE STUDENTS WORKING WITH AND DEVELOPING TRANSFORMATIVE AI AND DATA-ENABLED TECHNIQUES IN THE SERVICE OF PROBLEMS IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES.

 NJ HIV HOUSING COLLABORATIVE (INTENSIVE HOUSING CASE MANAGER POSITION): PILLAR 2 (TREAT)
 
 THE AIDS RESOURCE FOUNDATION FOR CHILDREN (ARFC) REQUESTS EHE FUNDING TO DISRUPT CYCLES OF CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS TO ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) AND GIVE THEM THE NEEDED SUPPORTS TO ACHIEVE AND RETAIN STABLE HOUSING AND INDEPENDENT LIVING. THROUGH OUR TRAUMA-INFORMED HOUSING MODEL, NEUROFEEDBACK TECHNOLOGY, AND CULTURALLY SENSITIVE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, WE SEEK TO EXPAND OUR RESPONSE TO THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SEEN THROUGH OUR STATEWIDE NEW JERSEY HOMELESS HOUSING COLLABORATIVE (NJHHC). THESE POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THEIR REPEATED INSTANCES OF CALLING THE NJHHCÃ‚  S HOMELESS HOTLINE FOR EMERGENCY HOUSING. SINCE SEPTEMBER OF 2019 REPEATED CALLERS ACCOUNT FOR CLOSE TO 1 IN EVERY 4 PHONE INTAKES COMPLETED, HOWEVER, THIS NUMBER HAS BEEN STEADILY RISING SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND PERSISTS AS PEOPLE WHO WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY COVID-19 BEGIN TO REBUILD. 23% OF THESE CALLERS HAVE CONTACTED THE HOMELESS HOTLINE 3 OR MORE TIMES. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, PLWHA SUFFERING REPEATED CYCLES OF HOMELESSNESS ARE BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN, ESPECIALLY WOMEN, STRUGGLING WITH SUBSTANCE USE, AND/OR TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS. WHILE OUR CURRENT HOUSING INTERVENTION HAS SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITIONED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE OUT OF HOMELESSNESS, THIS SYSTEM IS NOT SERVING THESE SPECIAL POPULATIONS IN A LONGER TERM CAPACITY.  USING THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL AND THE SERVICES OF AN INTENSIVE HOUSING CASE MANAGER, WE PROPOSE A DISRUPTIVELY INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO HOUSING STABILIZATION WHICH WILL CONNECT A VULNERABLE PERSON LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS TO BARRIER-FREE, IMMEDIATE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES DESIGNED TO HOLISTICALLY SUPPORT A PERSON BY PLACING THEM AT THE CENTER OF THEIR CARE. 
 
 NEEDS ASSESSMENT:          
 BOTH THE ARFC AND THE HEADQUARTERS OF OUR STATEWIDE HOUSING COLLABORATIVE NJHHC ARE LOCATED IN ESSEX COUNTY, NEWARK, NEW JERSEY, WHICH RANKS FIRST IN THE STATE OF RATES OF NEW DIAGNOSIS AND IN PREVALENCE OF HIV.  IN OVER 30 YEARS OF OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THIS COUNTY, WE HAVE SEEN DECADES OF INSTANCES WHICH CORRESPOND WITH THE FOLLOWING DATA TRENDS OF THE EPIDEMIC:
 
 HIV AFFECTS THE BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY MORE THAN ANY OTHER RACIAL, ETHNIC, OR DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP. ACCORDING TO THE ENDING THE HIV EPIDEMIC 2020 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PROFILE FOR ESSEX COUNTY, NEW JERSEY: AS OF 2018, APPROXIMATELY 77.6% OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED HIV INFECTIONS AMONG WOMEN WAS AMONG BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICANS AS COMPARED TO 54.55% OF THE INFECTION AMONG MALES. AS OF 2018, BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN NON-HISPANICS WHO REPRESENT ONLY 39.3% OF THE ESSEX COUNTY POPULATION, ACCOUNT FOR 68.8% OF THE PERSONS WITH HIV CASES AND 61.8% OF NEW HIV INFECTIONS. THESE STATISTICS ARE CATALYZED BY CO-OCCURRING MARGINALIZATIONS IN ESSEX COUNTY. BARRIERS TO ACHIEVING INDEPENDENT LIVING, SUCH AS THE INCREASING COST OF LIVING, ARE COMPOUNDED BY THE HOUSING CRISIS AND AN ECONOMY THAT CONTINUES TO RECOVER FROM AN UNPRECEDENTED PANDEMIC. THE AVERAGE FAMILY COMPOSITION IS 5 OR MORE PERSONS. THE AVERAGE INCOME FOR THESE FAMILIES IS LESS THAN $8,000 PER YEAR. WITH THE YEARLY INCREASE IN RENTAL COSTS, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOME TO MAINTAIN AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITHOUT ASSISTANCE. THIS DATA IS CONSISTENT WITH TRENDS WE HAVE SEEN THROUGH THE NJHHC HOMELESS HOTLINE. WE HAVE INDICATED AN INCREASE, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE TIME OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, OF CHRONICALLY HOMELESS PLWHA CALLING IN NEED OF REPEATED HELP. THE DEMOGRAPHICS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM INCLUDE PLWHA WITH EXPERIENCES OF: CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, SUBSTANCE USE, AND LGBTQ+ IDENTITY.
 
 ANYTHING THAT INTERFERES WITH HIV TREATMENT MUST BECOME PART OF HIV CARE. WE PROPOSE TO MEET THE EMERGING NEEDS OF THESE SPECIAL POPULATIONS WITH A DISRUPTIVE APPROACH TO CARE.  UNDER THE EHEÃ‚  S TREAT PILLAR, WE PROPOSE TO CONTINUE OUR WORK TO DISRUPT CYCLES OF CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED EXTREME AND REPEATED INSTANCES OF HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING INSTABILITY WITHIN THE LAST YEAR. 
 
 OUR POPULATION: 
 AS THE LEAD OF THE STATEWIDE NEW JERSEY HOMELESS HOUSING COLLABORATIVE, THE ARFC OPERATES THE HOMELESS HOTLINE. THIS IS A 24/7 HOTLINE OPERATED BY EMERGENCY HOUSING COORDINATORS WHO IMMEDIATELY CONNECT A CALLER TO HOUSING. SINCE 2018, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RESPONDED TO ALL OF THE OVER 2,000 CALLS WE HAVE RECEIVED. THROUGH THESE CALLS, AND ESPECIALLY AS VULNERABLE POPULATIONS BECAME EVEN MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO HARDSHIP, HOUSING INSTABILITY, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND SUBSTANCE OVERDOSE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE HAVE NOTICED A PATTERN. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, CALLERS ARE BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN, ESPECIALLY WOMEN, STRUGGLING WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER, AND TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS. 
   
 FOUNDATION SERVICES:
 ARFC IS THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING TO PLWHA IN THE STATE. AS PART OF ITS COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLE HEALTH AND THE WELL-BEING OF VULNERABLE HIV-IMPACTED INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES, THE ARFC OPERATES ST. CLAREÃ‚  S HOUSING PROGRAM, A SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES LONG- AND SHORT-TERM RENTAL ASSISTANCE; RELATED UTILITIES ASSISTANCE; HOUSING INFORMATION AND CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. TO SUPPORT THIS GOAL, THE ARFC MANAGES AND MAINTAINS 40 SCATTERED-SITE HOMES THROUGHOUT NEWARK AND SURROUNDING AREAS. BOTH RESIDENTS AND NON-RESIDENTS OF THE ST. CLAREÃ‚  S HOUSING PROGRAM ARE SUPPORTED BY ST. CLARE'S SOCIAL SERVICES WHICH PROVIDES HIV-IMPACTED INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH CORE SERVICES THAT INCLUDE SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION, INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT, MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION, AND MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE ST. CLAREÃ‚  S HOUSING PROGRAM NATURALLY LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NJHHC, WHICH LEVERAGES STATEWIDE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT HOMELESS PLWHA BY PROVIDING EMERGENCY HOUSING AND LINKAGE INTO HIV CARE. THESE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES ALLOW THE ARFC TO WORK TO FIGHT STIGMA, LESSEN DISPARITIES IN EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE, AND HELP INDIVIDUALS TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES IN A SAFE STABLE HOME. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL ALLOW US TO DEVELOP MORE TARGETED SERVICES TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. 
 
 SERVICES THAT EXPAND OR ENHANCE EXISTING HIV SERVICES:
 WE WILL USE EHE FUNDING TO PROVIDE INTENSIVE HOUSING CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE ASKS US TO SEE A PERSONÃ‚  S CURRENT STATE OF BEING AS A CUMULATIVE RESULT OF THE EXPERIENCES THAT THEYÃ‚  VE HAD. WE BELIEVE THAT ONE FLAW IN THE SYSTEM THAT LEADS TO REPEAT CYCLES OF HOMELESSNESS FOR PLWHA IS THAT A TRAUMA-INFORMED ASSESSMENT CANNOT BE MADE DURING A MOMENT OF CRISIS. WHEN SOMEONE CALLS THE HOMELESS HOTLINE, THEY ARE CALLING FROM (REAL EXAMPLES FOLLOW) LIVING IN BUS STOPS, CONDEMNED BUILDINGS, ABANDONED CARS, TRADING SEX FOR HOUSING, AND IN DOMESTICALLY VIOLENT HOMES. WHEN WE MEET A PERSON FOR THEIR INITIAL INTAKE, IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR SURVIVAL MECHANISMS AND DEFENSES ARE TRIGGERED. BECAUSE A CYCLE OF EMERGENCY HOUSING AND SHELTER MAY HAVE ALREADY ACTIVATED PRIMAL DEFENSE MECHANISMS, WE PROPOSE TO USE TRAUMA-INFORMED INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT TO QUICKLY LINK THE CLIENT INTO STABILIZED HOUSING AND SERVICES.
 
 WE WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS INCLUDING REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS, ST. CLARE'S HOUSING, AND ESSEX COUNTY COC TO CONNECT EACH CLIENT WITH HOUSING VOUCHERS THAT WILL HELP THEM TO ACHIEVE INDEPENDENT LIVING.
 
 INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT GOALS INCLUDE: BETTER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES, VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION, A HOUSING STABILITY PLAN, AND CONNECTION TO CULTURALLY COMPETENT SUPPORTIVE RESOURCES. ALL OF WHICH WILL HELP CLIENTS TO REMAIN STABLY HOUSED, TREATMENT ADHERENT, AND GIVE THEM AN EMPOWERED TOOLKIT FOR LIVING WITH TRAUMATIC SYMPTOMS.
 
 THROUGH RYAN WHITE FUNDING, WE HAVE PROVIDED PLWHA EMERGENCY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND SHORT-TERM EMERGENCY HOUSING. THROUGH NJ DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH FUNDING, WE CURRENTLY OPERATE TWO TRAUMA-INFORMED 24-MONTH LONG TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAMS FOR WOMEN LIVING AT THE INTERSECTION OF HIV/AIDS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE (THE SALON) AND YOUNG (18-25) GAY MEN (PROJECT NEST). THROUGH THE NJHHC, WE HAVE CONNECTED OVER 2,000 CALLERS TO EMERGENCY HOUSING SOLUTIONS WITH A DEDICATED TEAM AND STATEWIDE NETWORK OF HOUSING AMBASSADORS.
 
 THE PROPOSED MODEL IS A DISRUPTION OF HOUSING SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE TIME, LEVEL OF SUPPORT, REMOVAL OF BARRIERS, AND UNIQUE PAIRING OF SERVICES PROVIDED.
 
 NOVEL APPROACHES THAT ACHIEVE VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION:
 INNOVATION IS NEEDED TO SERVE THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO HOUSING INSTABILITY IN ESSEX COUNTY, NJ. THE ONE-YEAR ESTIMATE OF HOMELESS IN NEWARK/ESSEX COUNTY CONTINUUM OF CARE, ACCORDING THE THE POINT-IN-TIME ESTIMATES FOR HOMELESS POPULATIONS WAS 2,235 PERSONS. OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION DOCUMENTED, THE NUMBERS OF BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN WERE 1,787 AS OPPOSED TO 391 WHITE.
 
 THIS IS CONSISTENT TO DATA WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE NJHHC:
 - SINCE 9/3/2019, 141 CLIENTS RETURNED TO THE HOMELESS HOTLINE FOR ASSISTANCE. 
 - THE CALLERS ACCOUNTED FOR CLOSE TO 1 IN EVERY 4 PHONE INTAKES (23%). 
 - THIS TREND HAS BEEN TRENDING UP SINCE OUR FIRST QUARTERLY DATA REPORT IN MARCH OF 2020. 
 - 33 OF THE 141 CALLERS HAVE CONTACTED THE HOMELESS HOTLINE 3 OR MORE TIMES (23%).
 - ESSEX COUNTY ACCOUNTED FOR 39% OF THESE CALLERS (56)
 - GENDER OF THE CALLERS WERE MALE (100), FEMALE (33), AND TRANSGENDER (8). 
 - THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE CALLER WAS 45 YEARS OLD. 
 - 67% OF THE CALLERS WERE BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN.  
 - 36% OF THE CALLERS REPORTED BEING UNSHELTERED (ON THE STREETS) THE NIGHT BEFORE THEIR MOST RECENT PHONE INTAKE. 
 - THE CALLERS REPORTED HAVING NO INCOME (74), RECEIVING UNEARNED INCOME (58), AND EARNED INCOME (9). 
 
 LOCAL AWARENESS CAMPAIGN:
 THE NJHHC WILL WORK WITH OUR PIPELINE OF STATEWIDE HOUSING AMBASSADORS TO DEVELOP AN AWARENESS CAMPAIGN ABOUT WORKING WITH PLWHA EXPERIENCING CHRONIC CYCLES OF HOMELESSNESS. WE WILL USE COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE TO IDENTIFY COMMON BARRIERS AND COMMON SOLUTIONS AND USE OUR CAMPAIGN TO ADVOCATE FOR NEW LANGUAGE, IDEAS, AND SOLUTIONS FOR PLWHA EXPERIENCING REPEATED INSTANCES OF HOMELESSNESS.
 
 STATUS NEUTRAL PLAN FOR LINKAGE TO CARE:
 WHEN SOMEONE CALLS THE NJHHC AND THEY ARE NOT HIV POSITIVE, WE MAKE A REFERRAL TO ANOTHER PROVIDER AND/OR MAINSTREAM SERVICES (211) AND DO NOT COMPLETE AN INTAKE. WE ESPECIALLY REFER THESE CALLERS TO OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS WHO OFFER PREP SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, ESSEX COUNTY HOMELESS CONTINUUM OF CARE (COC) CAN ASSESS THE PERSONÃ‚  S NEEDS AND PROVIDE HOMELESS PREVENTION OR SERVICES TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. 
 
 COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROJECT:
 THE ARFC HAS BEEN WORKING WITH HAGER HEALTH, LLC (DBA READY, AIM, INNOVATE) TO BRING A DYNAMIC STORYTELLING PROJECT TO A DIVERSITY OF COHORTS IN THE GREATER NEWARK AND JERSEY CITY AREAS. POPULATIONS OF FOCUS AND KEY QUESTIONS OF INTEREST ARE DEVELOPED IN DISCUSSION WITH HIV PLANNING BODIES LIKE NEMA REC SUBCOMMITTEE AND THE HPG CEC SUBCOMMITTEE. TO DEVELOP STORIES, WE WORK WITH STORYTELLING ARTISTS SUCH AS VIDEOGRAPHERS, ACTORS, DESIGNERS, AND MUSICIANS TO OFFER STORYTELLING WORKSHOPS IN A GROUP SETTING. EACH WORKSHOP GIVES PARTICIPANTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE WHAT MEDIUM THEY WANT TO WORK WITH: VIDEOGRAPHY, PHOTOGRAPHY, ORATION, AND WRITING. WE HAVE PRIORITIZED USING CREATIVE MEDIUMS TO HELP PARTICIPANTS ARTICULATE STORIES ABOUT ROLE MODELS, DISCRIMINATION, RACISM, STIGMA, OVERCOMING OBSTACLES, STRUGGLE, SURVIVAL, FAILURE, SUCCESS, FACING AND CONQUERING CHALLENGES, ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT CONTINUES TO HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON BIPOC COMMUNITIES. THIS PROJECT HELPS TO CENTER EACH PARTICIPANT'S VOICE AND SHOW THEM THE POWER THEY CAN HAVE BY TAKING OWNERSHIP OF THAT STORY. THE GROUP WORK SESSIONS ARE DESIGNED TO REACH PARTICIPANTS OF ALL AGESÃ‚  WE HAVE WORKED WITH PEOPLE AS YOUNG AS 18 AND SENIORS OVER 70. ALL COHORTS ARE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN A COMMUNITY WIDE STORY SLAM WHERE COMMUNITY LEADERS COME AND SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES AS WELL. ALL WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE GROUP CYCLES ARE BE INVITED TO SHARE THEIRS AS WELL. LOCAL BUSINESSES, VENDORS, AND OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE INVITED TO HOLD A PRESENCE AT THE EVENT. IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THESE UNIFYING EVENTS BRING US TOGETHER THROUGH THE POWER OF SHARED STORIES. STORYTELLING DATA ARE CODED USING A QUALITATIVE CODEBOOK DEVELOPED BY ARFC IN 2023. THE CODED DATA WILL BE SHARED BACK WITH STORYTELLERS IN FOCUS GROUPS TO GAIN ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY INPUT ON THE BEST COLLECTIVE COURSE OF ACTION FOR SERVICE AND POLICYMAKING STAKEHOLDERS TO TAKE IN ENDING THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN NJ.
 
 
 OBJECTIVES FOR NJHHC INTENSIVE HOUSING CASE MANAGER:
 IN ORDER TO DEVELOP LONGER-TERM, TRAUMA-INFORMED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL BE AN EFFECTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO THE EHE GOAL OF VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION BY ENGAGING THOSE WHO ARE MOST DIFFICULT TO RETAIN IN CARE AND STOPPING THE SPREAD OF THE HIV-VIRUS, WE WILL:
 
 -CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT OF A TRAUMA-INFORMED HOUSING ASSESSMENT WITH OUR PIPELINE OF STATEWIDE HOUSING CASE MANAGERS

 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY PI: DR. FUZHONG ZHANG
 
 PRAIRIE VIEW  A&M UNIVERSITY PI: DR. YINGCHUN LI
 
 OVERVIEW:
 THE EVOLVING GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGES AND FOSSIL FUEL RESOURCE DEPLETION MANDATE REPLACEMENT OF PETROLEUM-BASED FUELS WITH BIOFUELS. SIMULTANEOUSLY, PLASTIC WASTES IMPOSE A MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGE DUE TO LOW RECYCLING RATES (~15%), HIGH ANNUAL PRODUCTION (>350 MILLION TONS), AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERSISTENCE. TECHNICAL ADVANCES CAN ADDRESS BOTH CHALLENGES.
 
 THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE MAJOR FACTORS THAT CAUSE CELL-TO-CELL VARIABILITY IN BIOPRODUCTION OF BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS AND TO DEVELOP TOOLS TO REDUCE SUCH VARIABILITY, THEREFORE IMPROVING BIOCONVERSION EFFICIENCY AND BATCH-TO-BATCH REPRODUCIBILITY. THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON TWO INDUSTRIALLY-RELEVANT MICROBIAL SPECIESÃ‚  P. PUTIDA AND R. OPACUSÃ‚  FOR THEIR PRODUCTION OF BIODEGRADABLE PLASTIC PRECURSOR (PHA) AND BIODIESEL PRECURSOR (LIPIDS), RESPECTIVELY. THE SUCCESS FACTORS ARE TO PROVIDE SYSTEMATIC AND QUANTITATIVE UNDERSTANDING ON THE SOURCES OF VARIABILITY IN THESE BIOCONVERSION SYSTEMS. THE TARGETED PERFORMANCE IS TO DEVELOP TOOLS THAT CAN REDUCE CELL-TO-CELL VARIABILITY, AS QUANTIFIED USING NOISE (ÃŽÂ·2, I.E. SQUARE OF COEFFICIENT OF VARIANCE) OF SINGLE-CELL PRODUCT CONCENTRATION, BY AT LEAST 60%. AND THIS REDUCTION ON BIOPRODUCTION VARIABILITY WILL LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS OF TITERS AND YIELDS BY AT LEAST 100% BY THE END OF THE PROJECT PERIOD. THE RESULTANT TEAM EFFORT WILL PROVIDE MULTIDISCIPLINARY SUPPORT FOR BETOÃ‚  S (BIOENERGY TECHNOLOGIES OFFICE) MISSION ON DEVELOPING COMMERCIAL-SCALE BIOREFINERIES OF AFFORDABLE BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE SPECIFIC MISSION OF THIS FOA FUNDING OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT) (ON IMPROVING THE ROBUSTNESS OF MICROBIAL BIOCONVERSION.
 
 
 OBJECTIVES:
 
 TASK 3: DEVELOP TOOLS TO REDUCE AND REGULATE CELL-TO-CELL VARIATION (ZHANG, LI).
 TASK SUMMARY: THIS TASK WILL DEVELOP COMPUTATIONAL MODELS TO SIMULATE SEVERAL GENE CIRCUITS WITH DIFFERENT REGULATORY TOPOLOGIES ON THEIR ABILITIES IN REDUCING BIOPRODUCTION VARIATION AS WELL AS IMPROVING OVERALL CONVERSION YIELD AND PRODUCTIVITY. TO EXPERIMENTALLY IMPLEMENT THESE GENE CIRCUITS AS WELL AS REDUCING THE MAJOR NOISE SOURCE(S) AS IDENTIFIED FROM TASK 2, THIS TASK WILL ALSO DEVELOP GENETIC TOOLS TO REDUCE THE VARIABILITY OF ENZYMES, METABOLIC PRECURSORS/INTERMEDIATE, THEREBY IMPROVING THE ROBUSTNESS OF CONVERSION.
 SUBTASK 3.1 MODELING THE EFFECT OF GENE CIRCUITS ON HETEROGENEITY REDUCTION. (ZHANG, LI). 
 SUBTASK SUMMARY: GENE CIRCUITS THAT CAN DIFFERENTIATE SUBPOPULATIONS (E.G. POPQC) CAN ENRICH HIGH-PRODUCING CELLS AND IMPROVE OVERALL TITERS AND YIELD. POPULATION-DIFFERENTIABLE GENE CIRCUITS (PODGCS) CAN BE BUILT IN NUMEROUS WAYS TO EITHER SELECT CELLS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF PATHWAY ENZYME OR CELLS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF BIOPRODUCT5,19. DIFFERENT SELECTION STRATEGIES MAY RESULT IN DIFFERENT PRODUCTION PERFORMANCE DEPENDING ON THEIR PARAMETERS, RESPONSE TIME, AND THE FLUCTUATION DYNAMICS OF THE PRODUCTS. TO EXPLORE WHICH TYPE OF PODGC AND PARAMETER SETTINGS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING HETEROGENEITY AND IMPROVING OVERALL TITERS, YIELDS, AND PRODUCTIVITIES, THIS SUBTASK WILL DEVELOP COMPUTATIONAL MODELS TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PODGCS.
  
 FIG 7. COMPUTATIONAL MODELS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF GENE CIRCUITS ON HETEROGENEITY REDUCTION.  (A) MODEL-SIMULATED SINGLE-CELL METABOLITE (ÃŽÂ²-XANTHIN) CONCENTRATION TRAJECTORIES (BOTTOM) ARE CONSISTENT WITH EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS (TOP). (B) MODELED DISTRIBUTION OF SINGLE-CELL ÃŽÂ²-XANTHIN CONCENTRATION IS CONSISTENT WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA. (C) MODELED ENZYME-METABOLITE CROSS-CORRELATION CURVE IS COMPARED TO THAT OF CALCULATED FROM EXPERIMENTAL DATA. (D-G) PROPOSED PODGCS TO STUDY THEIR EFFECTS ON VARIABILITY REDUCTION. 
 SUBTASK DETAILS: WE WILL FIRST DEVELOP A STOCHASTIC MODEL FRAMEWORK FOR SINGLE CELL METABOLITE PRODUCTION BASED ON A SIMPLIFIED PATHWAY (E.G. THE FA BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAY, FIG 3A) SIMILAR TO A PUBLISHED STOCHASTIC MODEL BUT USING OUR EXPERIMENTAL DATA FOR PARAMETERIZATION45. THE MODEL WILL CONSIDER, IN A SINGLE CELL, STOCHASTIC ENZYME EXPRESSION, METABOLITE PRODUCTION BY ENZYMATIC REACTIONS, A GROWTH FACTOR TO REPRESENT THE CELLÃ‚  S OVERALL METABOLIC STATE FOR STOCHASTIC SIMULATION, PODGC COMPONENTS (E.G. A SELECTOR PROTEIN), AND DILUTION BY CELL GROWTH. STOCHASTIC GILLESPIE SIMULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED TO EXAMINE THE FLUCTUATION OF EACH MOLECULAR SPECIES IN A SINGLE CELL, AND MULTIPLE HUNDREDS OF CELLS WILL BE SIMULATED TO OBTAIN CELL-TO-CELL HETEROGENEITY INFORMATION45. WITHIN EACH CYCLE, THE SIMULATION WILL ACCOUNT FOR INCREASES IN CELL SIZE ACCORDING TO THE GROWTH RATE, WHICH WILL BE CALCULATED AT EACH TIME STEP USING A HILL FUNCTION OF THE GROWTH FACTOR. THE OVERALL FERMENTATION YIELD AND TITER WILL BE CALCULATED BY CONSIDERING THE DEPLETION OF CARBON SOURCE FROM THE ENTIRE CELL POPULATION USING THE MONOD EQUATION. THE MODEL WILL BE PARAMETERIZED USING EXPERIMENTALLY MEASURED ENZYME EXPRESSION NOISE VALUES AS WELL AS PUBLISHED LITERATURE VALUES ON ENZYME AND GROWTH KINETICS16. PREVIOUSLY, WE HAVE APPLIED SUCH STOCHASTIC MODEL TO SIMULATE THE BIOPRODUCTION OF ÃŽÂ²-XANTHIN (A FLUORESCENCE DYE) IN E. COLI, AND HAVE OBTAINED EXCELLENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN SIMULATED HETEROGENEITY CHARACTERISTICS WITH EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS (FIG 7A-C).
 USING THIS STOCHASTIC MODEL FRAMEWORK, WE WILL THEN STUDY THE EFFECTS OF 4 DIFFERENT PODGCS ON REDUCING BIOPRODUCTION HETEROGENEITY (FIG 7D-G). (I) ENZYME-FEEDBACK-TO-GROWTH COUPLES SINGLE-CELL ENZYME EXPRESSION NOISE TO THE EXPRESSION OF A SELECTION GENE THAT WILL BE USED TO ACTIVATE CELL GROWTH. (II) GROWTH-FEEDBACK-TO-EXPRESSION COUPLES THE NOISE OF GROWTH FACTOR TO THE EXPRESSION OF PATHWAY ENZYME. (III) METABOLITE-FEEDBACK-TO-GROWTH COUPLES THE NOISE OF METABOLITE PRODUCT TO CELL GROWTH. AND (IV) METABOLITE-FEEDBACK-TO-EXPRESSION COUPLES THE NOISE OF METABOLITE PRODUCT TO THE EXPRESSION OF ITS OWN PATHWAY ENZYME. HETEROGENEOUS METABOLITE BIOPRODUCTION UNDER THE CONTROL OF THESE 4 PODGCS WILL BE SIMULATED. THE RESULTING VARIABILITY ON METABOLITE CONCENTRATION AND OVERALL FERMENTATION TITER, YIELD, AND PRODUCTIVITY WILL BE COMPARED TO THOSE WITHOUT PODGC. THE MOST EFFECTIVE PODGC WILL BE IDENTIFIED.
 
 MILESTONE 3.1.1: COMPUTATIONALLY QUANTIFY THE FOLD OF ENHANCEMENT ON FERMENTATION TITER, YIELD, AND RATE FOR 4 DIFFERENT PODGCS FROM NON-STRAIN-SPECIFIC MODELS
 MILESTONE 3.1.2: IDENTIFY THE BEST PODGC THAT CAN ENHANCE CONVERSION YIELD BY >100%, TITER BY >200% AND RATE BY >200%.
 
 SUBTASK 3.3 DEVELOP TOOLS TO REDUCE VARIABILITY ON METABOLITE ABUNDANCE (ZHANG, LI). 
 SUBTASK SUMMARY: IN THIS SUBTASK, WE WILL DEVELOP TOOLS TO REDUCE VARIABILITY ON KEY METABOLITES, TAKING ACYL-ACP AS AN EXAMPLE. NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS WILL BE BUILT TO CONTROL ACYL-COA BIOSYNTHESIS. THE ACYL-COA SENSOR WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF VARIABILITY REDUCTION. 
 SUBTASK DETAILS: NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOP (NFL) HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE GENE EXPRESSION NOISE, BUT IT HAS NEVER BEEN USED TO REDUCE METABOLITE NOISE47. WE WILL CONSTRUCT METABOLIC NFLS TO REGULATED ACYL-COA CONCENTRATION BY USING THE ACYL-COA-RESPONSIVE PROMOTER TO CONTROL THE EXPRESSION OF MAJOR ACYL-COA BIOSYNTHETIC GENES. MEANWHILE, THE STRENGTH OF FEEDBACK WILL BE TUNED BY VARYING THE STRENGTH OF ACYL-COA-ACTIVATED PROMOTERS. THE NFL DESIGN PRINCIPLE WILL BE FIRST VALIDATED IN E. COLI BY CONTROLLING ACYL-COA SYNTHASE (FADD, FIG 8B) EXPRESSION. ACYL-COA NFL WILL THEN BY TESTED IN P. PUTIDA AND R. OPACUS BY CONTROLLING FABI AND FASI (FIG 8C), RESPECTIVELY.   
 EXPECTED RESULT: WE EXPECT TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF 4 PODGC ON BIOPRODUCTION, WITH THE BEST PODGC TO ENHANCE TITER/YIELD/RATE BY >100% AS SHOWN IN TABLE 1. WE ALSO EXPECT TO CREATE AND CHARACTERIZE NAR PROMOTERS AND NFLS THAT CAN REDUCE ENZYME EXPRESSION NOISE AND ACYL-COA NOISE BY >60%, RESPECTIVELY. SUCH RESULTS WILL CONSTANTLY FEED TO TASK 4 FOR TEA/LCA CALCULATIONS.
 
 MILESTONE 3.3: CREATE NFL TOOLS THAT CAN SENSE THE INTRACELLULAR CONCENTRATION OF ACYL-COA AND NEGATIVELY FEEDBACK REGULATE THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF ACYL-COA, THUS REDUCING CELL-TO-CELL VARIABILITY OF ACYL-COA. THE SPECIFIC MILESTONE IS TO REDUCE ACYL-COA NOISE BY >60% FROM UNREGULATED MODEL E. COLI STRAINS.
 
 
 ADDITIONALLY, CO-PI LI FROM PRAIRIE VIEW A&M UNIVERSITY (PVAMU) WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS DEI PLAN. WE AIM TO FOSTER AN INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR DIVERSE TEAM AND ENSURE PROJECT OUTCOMES ARE SHARED AND IMPACTFUL TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY GROUPS (URGS). OUR OVERALL VISION FOR THE PROJECT DEI PLAN IS TO FOSTER A WELCOMING AND INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR DIVERSE PROJECT TEAM, SUPPORT PEOPLE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN STEM, AND ENSURE THAT OUR PROJECT OUTCOMES IMPACT AND BENEFIT UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. OUR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES TO MEET THIS VISION ARE THE FOLLOWING:
 Ã‚ Â¢ OBJECTIVE 1: SUPPORT A DIVERSE TEAM WITH PROJECT FUNDS AND FOSTER A WELCOMING, AND INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE PROJECT TEAM.
 Ã‚ Â¢ OBJECTIVE 2: DISSEMINATE RESEARCH RESULTS TO UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS INTERESTED IN PURSUING STEM CAREERS.
 Ã‚ Â¢ OBJECTIVE 3: WORK WITH LOCAL INDUSTRIES TO DEVELOP A PATHWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGIES TO DIRECTLY BENEFIT AN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY AND IDENTIFY MINORITY BUSINESSES AS VENDORS.
 
 OBJECTIVE 1: SUPPORT A DIVERSE TEAM WITH PROJECT FUNDS AND FOSTER AN INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT 
 ANNUAL IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING AND INCLUSION ACTIVITIES. ALL PROJECT PARTICIPANTS WILL BE TRAINED TO IDENTIFY BIASES AND PROMOTE A CULTURE OF INCLUSIVENESS IN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ACTIVITIES. DR. ZHANG WILL WORK WITH WASHU DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES, THE WASHU ACADEMY OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION, AS WELL AS THE STUDENT RUN CENTER FOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION TO BUILD A SERIES OF CUSTOMIZED TRAINING SESSIONS FOR THE PROJECT TEAM. THE TRAININGS WILL BE DONE AS A GROUP ACROSS INSTITUTIONS USING VIRTUAL MEETING TOOLS. EACH ANNUAL SESSION WILL BUILD ON CONCEPTS TO HELP THE GROUP GROW AND WORK TOWARD A CONCRETE APPROACH FOR CREATING POSITIVE CHANGE WITHIN THEIR SUBPROJECT TEAMS, CAMPUSES, AND EVEN THE EXTERNAL COMMUNITY. SESSIONS WILL INCLUDE AWARENESS OF IMPLICIT BIASES, PROVIDING TOOLS TO REDUCE IMPLICIT BIASES, UNDERSTANDING HOW TO LEARN FROM EACH MEMBER OF THE TEAM, COMMITMENTS TO INCLUSION, AND SETTING SPECIFIC TEAM POLICIES AND EXPECTATION.  
 SUMMER UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH PROGRAM. (1) UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS FROM PVAMU. EXCEPT FOR DIRECTLY INVOLVE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS OF URGS FROM PVAMU IN THIS PROJECT, THE WUSTL TEAM WILL ALSO HOST THESE PVAMU STUDENTS IN WUSTL CAMPUS (ZHANG AND YUANÃ‚  S LABS) EVERY SUMMER FOR ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND BETTER INTEGRATION WITH THE REST OF THE TEAM. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH WUSTL PIS, POST-DOCTORAL FELLOWS AND PHD STUDENTS IN THE PROPOSED PROJECT (TASK 3). THE GOAL OF THIS OPPORTUNITY IS TO EXPOSE THE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TO A RESEARCH-INTENSE ENVIRONMENT AND TO INTRODUCE RESEARCH/ACADEMIC CAREER PATH TO THESE STUDENTS. WE HAVE BUDGETED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTÃ‚  S TRAVEL AND STAY IN ST. LOUIS. (2) UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS FROM WUSEF. ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL RECRUIT UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS OF URGS THROUGH THE WASHU SUMMER ENGINEERING FELLOWSHIP (WUSEF) PROGRAM. THE WUSEF PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE EXCEPTIONAL STUDENTS FROM BACKGROUNDS UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE STEM FIELDS, INCLUDING UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS, STUDENTS FROM ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AND UNDERSERVED BACKGROUNDS AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES, TO PARTICIPATE IN ENGINEERING RESEARCH. FELLOWS ENJOY A REWARDING SUMMER RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AT WASHU. THE WASHU OFFICE OF ENGINEERING STUDENT SERVICES HELPS RECRUIT APPLICANTS FOR WUSEF THEY TRAVEL TO THE 91 DUAL DEGREE AFFILIATED LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WITH WHOM THEY ALREADY HAVE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS. IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS, OVER 30% OF THE PROGRAM STUDENTS ARE FROM URGS. THE UNDERGRADS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN ALL PROJECT TRAINING ACTIVITIES AND TEAM MEETINGS. THE STUDENTS WILL EACH BE EXPECTED TO GIVE A PRESENTATION ON THEIR WORK TO THE TEAM AT A CONVENING EVENT AT THE END OF THE SUMMER. 
 GRADUATE STUDENT RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES. THE TEAM WILL LEVERAGE RESOURCES AT EACH INSTITUTION TO RECRUIT GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM URGS. THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED SUMMER RESEARCH STUDENTS FROM PVAMU WILL BE EXPOSED TO CAMPUS LIFE/CULTURE AT WASHU AND GUIDED IN GRADUATE APPLICATION IF THEY ARE INTERESTED. THOSE STUDENTS WILL CONVEY WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED AT WASHU BACK TO THEIR CLASSMATES AT PVAMU; THAT MAY ENCOURAGE MORE STUDENTS TO BECOME INTERESTED IN GRADUATE STUDIES. WE WILL PRESENT OUR FINDINGS TO THE BIOENGINEERING/CHEMICAL ENGINEERING PROGRAM AT PVAMU AS WELL AS OTHER HBCUS AND INTRODUCE OUR GRADUATE PROGRAMS TO THEIR STUDENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT RECRUITMENT PRACTICE AT EACH INSTITUTION, THE TEAM PLANS TO CONNECT WITH OTHER MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS FOR STUDENT RECRUITMENT. WE EXPECT URG STUDENTS WILL DEVELOP PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP AND LEVERAGE THAT FOR POTENTIAL CAREER PATH SUCH AS GRADUATE SCHOOL. 
 OBJECTIVE 2: DISSEMINATE RESEARCH RESULTS TO URGS INTERESTED IN PURSUING STEM CAREERS
 PROJECT LEADERSHIP WILL PRESENT AND PARTICIPATE IN SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCES FOR URGS, SUCH AS THE AFROBIOTECH CONFERENCE AND THE NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR BLACK ENGINEERS. BESIDES LEADERSHIP PRESENTATION, WE WILL ALSO SUPPORT A NUMBER OF URG STUDENTS TO GO TO THE CONFERENCE, WHERE THEY CAN LEARN ABOUT THE SCIENCE AND POTENTIAL CAREER PATHWAYS. IN ADDITION, THE RESEARCH RESULTS WILL BE DISSEMINATED THROUGH OTHER PLATFORMS FOR A BROADER IMPACT ON URGS. SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE BECOME A VERY EFFECTIVE AND ATTRACTIVE PLATFORM FOR DISSEMINATING NEW RESEARCH. THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS EQUIPPED US TO GET USED TO VIRTUAL MEETINGS/SEMINAR/TEACHING AND TO REALIZE SOME BENEFITS OF VIRTUAL APPROACHES: EASY ACCESS TO THE AUDIENCES. THUS, VIRTUAL SEMINARS/PRESENTATIONS WILL BE EMPLOYED TO DISSEMINATE THE RESEARCH RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT WHEN THERE ARE APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITIES/EVENTS. THE PI OR THE GRADUATE STUDENTS WILL UNDERTAKE TO ENGAGE IN SUCH PRESENTATIONS AND INTRODUCE SUSTAINABLE BIOPRODUCTION TO K-12 STUDENTS. PARTICULARLY, WE WILL ENSURE THE SCIENCE TEACHERS OF K12 STUDENTS ARE ADEQUATELY PREPARED. A TEACHER CAN POTENTIALLY INFLUENCE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STUDENTS INCLUDING THOSE IN URGS. IF FUNDED, WE WILL CONTINUE INVOLVE K12 TEACHERS IN OUR Ã‚  HOT TOPICS IN SYNTHETIC BIOLOGYÃ‚   WORKSHOPS AT WUSTL, SELECTED FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVING A LARGE PORTION OF URG STUDENTS. THEY TEACHERS WILL BE INTRODUCED KEY CONCEPT AND THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART IN BIOREFINERIES. 
 OBJECTIVE 3: WORK WITH LOCAL INDUSTRIES TO DEVELOP A PATHWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGIES TO DIRECTLY BENEFIT AN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY
 THE ST. LOUIS REGION HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS IN URGS. THE POPULATION OF ST. LOUIS CITY WAS ABOUT 49.2% BLACK, 43.9% WHITE (42.2% NON-HISPANIC WHITE), 2.9% ASIAN, 0.3% NATIVE AMERICAN/ALASKA NATIVE, AND 2.4% REPORTING TWO OR MORE RACES. IN ST. LOUIS COUNTY, THE POPULATION CONSISTS OF 68.3% WHITE, 35.3% AFRICAN AMERICAN, 0.2% NATIVE AMERICAN, 3.5% ASIAN, 0.03% PACIFIC ISLANDER, 0.9% FROM OTHER RACES, AND 1.9% FROM TWO OR MORE RACES AND 2.5% HISPANIC OR LATINO. THE WUSTL TEAM WILL WORK WITH LOCAL INDUSTRIES TO TRANSLATE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH TO PRACTICAL TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL BENEFIT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY SERVING UNDERSERVED POPULATION. THE TEAM WILL PRESENT THE RESEARCH FINDINGS TO ACS ST. LOUIS REGIONAL MEETINGS AND EVENTS, RECEIVE FEEDBACK ABOUT OUR WORK, INVOLVE ST. LOUIS REGIONAL PARTNERS, AND DISCUSS PATHWAYS FOR TECHNOLOGY LICENSING, TRANSFER, AND COLLABORATION BEYOND THIS DOE PROJECT. WE WILL IDENTIFY MINORITY BUSINESS ENTERPRISES, MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES, WOMAN OWNED BUSINESSES AND VETERAN OWNED BUSINESSES TO SOLICIT AS COLLABORATOR OR PARTNERS TO USE OUR DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES. THE TEAM WILL WORK WITH THE WASHU OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT ON PARTNERSHIP (E.G. NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT), IP LICENSING, AND TRANSFER.

 THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONÃ‚  S IMPROVING UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION FOR HISPANIC SERVING
 INSTITUTIONS (NSF IUSE HSI) GRANT PROGRAMÃ‚  S PURPOSE IS TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY AND THE DIVERSITY
 OF UNDERGRADUATE STEM EDUCATION IN TERMS OF RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, AND GRADUATION RATES OF
 STUDENTS PURSUING ASSOCIATES OR BACCALAUREATE DEGREES IN STEM. THE INTENDED OUTCOME OF THE
 IUSE HSI GRANT PROGRAM IS TO BROADEN THE PARTICIPATION OF STUDENTS WHO ARE HISTORICALLY
 UNDERREPRESENTED IN STEM (INCLUDING HISPANICS/ LATINOS/AS/XS).
 UCSCÃ‚  S COMPUTATIONAL MEDIA DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING THAT CABRILLOÃ‚  S COMPUTER SCIENCE (CS)
 DEPARTMENT FACULTY JOIN AN NSF IUSE HSI GRANT TO FURTHER EXPAND THE PIPELINE OF OUR
 UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE. THE NEXT PHASE IS TO APPLY FOR AN
 IMPLEMENTATION GRANT THAT WOULD ENABLE UCSC TO PARTNER WITH CABRILLO ON EXPANDING THE
 PROJECT TO CABRILLO STUDENTS Ã‚   INCLUDING OUR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. THIS PROJECT'S PURPOSE
 IS TO PROVIDE A MORE ACCESSIBLE PATHWAY / PIPELINE FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE
 LATINO/HISPANIC TO EXPLORE AREAS OF COMPUTING, TO FIND PEER SUPPORT IN PERSISTING IN THEIR COLLEGE
 PATHWAYS, AND TO DEEPEN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF VARIOUS FIELDS OF STUDY & RESEARCH WITHIN
 COMPUTING.
 BACKGROUND
 UCSC'S COMPUTATIONAL MEDIA DEPARTMENT FACULTY MEMBER, DAVID LEE, WAS PREVIOUSLY AWARDED
 AN NSF IUSE GRANT CALLED IMPROVING UNDERGRADUATE COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION VIA READING
 GROUP NETWORKS (NSF AWARD #1807388). DAVID LEE RUNS THE TECH4GOOD LAB, WHERE HE OVERSEES
 120 STUDENTS. THESE EXPLORATION READING GROUPS (ERG) SEEK TO FOSTER CREATIVE, RELATIONAL, AND
 STUDENTÃ‚  DRIVEN EXPLORATION IN THEMES WITHIN COMPUTING AND HELP TO ESTABLISH PIPELINES FOR
 STUDENTS TO PARTAKE IN UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES. THESE COURSES FOCUS ON THE MORE
 CURIOUS AND MOTIVATIONÃ‚  DRIVEN ASPECTS OF COMPUTING IN ORDER TO ENGAGE ALL STUDENTS Ã‚   INCLUDING
 THOSE UNDERREPRESENTED IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. IN A 1Ã‚  UNIT COURSE, TWICE PER QUARTER, STUDENTS
 BROWSE THEMES OF COMPUTING THAT RELATE TO SOCIETY AND DISCUSS IN STUDENTÃ‚  DRIVEN READING
 GROUPS, INCLUDING MAKING A FINAL PRESENTATION. THE GRANT HELPS STUDENTS TO OBTAIN GREATER CLARITY
 AND CONFIDENCE IN CS CAREER GOALS, TO CREATE SUPPORTIVE PEER RELATIONSHIPS, TO CREATE A SENSE OF
 BELONGING, AND TO LEARN MORE ABOUT POTENTIAL RESEARCH LAB OPPORTUNITIES TO DEEPEN THEIR
 KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IN VARIOUS AREAS OF COMPUTING.
 CABRILLOÃ‚  S ROLE ON THIS INVOLVES:
 1) EXPANDING EXPLORATORY READING GROUPS (ERG) AS A 1Ã‚  UNIT COURSE AT CABRILLO FOR STUDENTS
 WHO WANT TO EXPLORE ALL THE INTERESTING AREAS OF WORK THAT RELY ON COMPUTING;
 2) OUTREACH TO CABRILLO STUDENTS TO ENGAGE IN ERG CS AND ENGINEERING EXPLORATION COURSES Ã‚  
 ENGAGING WITH THE STEM CENTER, COUNSELORS & SSSS, AND POSSIBLY FACULTY PRESENTING /
 TABLING AT VENUES TO INCREASE STUDENT AWARENESS OF ERG COURSES;
 3) THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME CABRILLO STUDENTS WHO ARE CS MAJORS TO GET ACCESS TO RESEARCH
 LAB OPPORTUNITIES AT UCSC IN THEIR FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMORE YEARSÃ‚  .
 PROPOSED ACTIVITIES / INTERVENTIONS
 Ã‚   CS DEPARTMENT CHAIR TO WORK WITH UCSCÃ‚  S DAVID LEE TO DEVELOP A 1Ã‚  UNIT NONÃ‚  CREDIT
 COURSE THROUGH CURRICULUM REVIEW TO ALLOW FOR ERG COURSES ON COMPUTING TOPICS TO BE
 OFFERED ON THE CABRILLO CAMPUS; THESE ARE STUDENTÃ‚  LED COURSES THAT ALLOW FOR PEERÃ‚  TOPEERS
 SUPPORT FOR CS MAJORS TO EXPLORE COMPUTING TOPICS (2 TO 3 THEMES EACH COURSE).
 Ã‚   CABRILLO FACULTY CAN SERVE AS SPONSORS OR COÃ‚  SPONSORS ON ERG COURSES AND
 COLLABORATE WITH UCSC FACULTY WHO ARE DOING RESEARCH IN COURSE TOPIC AREAS.
 Ã‚   AS COÃ‚  PI, CS FACULTY MEMBER WILL:
 Ã‚   WORK ON OUTREACH TO HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE STUDENTS ABOUT ERG COURSES (1Ã‚  UNIT

THE ASEE DIVERSITY RECOGNITION PROGRAM [ADRP] TODAY REPRESENTS ONE OF THE LARGEST INSTITUTIONAL EFFORTS TO DOCUMENT AND COMMEND DEI EFFORTS IN U.S. STEM HIGHER EDUCATION. IT HAS ENLISTED OVER 130 POSTSECONDARY ENGINEERING PROGRAMS AT THE INITIAL Ã‚  SILVERÃ‚   LEVEL OF DEI CERTIFICATION, OF WHICH MANY HAVE NOW MOVED OR ANTICIPATE MOVING UP TO THE Ã‚  BRONZEÃ‚   LEVEL. THE VARIETY OF PROGRAMS REPRESENTED BY ADRP CERTIFICATION IS UNDERSTOOD BY THE ASEE DEANS COUNCIL, WHICH BEARS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS, TO REFLECT DIFFERING SCALES, GEOGRAPHIES, STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND LEVELS OF RESOURCING ACROSS U.S. ENGINEERING PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT ASEE DOES NOT YET HAVE A SENSE OF HOW THESE DIFFERENCES PLAY OUT IN THE CONTEXT OF DEI  CERTIFICATION.
 WITH A PERSPECTIVE INFORMED BY HISTORICAL RACE- AND ENGINEERING STUDIES AND BY CRITICAL RACE THEORY, WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND HOW ADRP RECOGNITION MAY REFLECT MULTIPLE AIMS AND IMPACTS ACROSS VARIOUS SCHOOLS: I.E. HOW IT ENABLES CHANGE OR ELIDES STASIS IN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. WE INTERROGATE HOW CERTIFICATION IN SOME CASES EMPOWERS FACULTY AND STAFF TO ENACT REFORM AND IN OTHERS SERVES AS SOMETHING OF AN OUTWARD-FACING GESTURE BY AN INSTITUTION IN LIEU OF DEEP COMMITMENTS OF RESOURCES AND CULTURAL REFLECTION. OUR INITIAL RESEARCH HAS INVOLVED THE FORMULATION OF A 9-MEMBER Ã‚  CRITICAL COHORTÃ‚   CONSISTING OF EARLY- AND MID- CAREER FACULTY AND STAFF ENGAGED IN DEI LABOR, WITH AND WITHOUT DIRECT ADRP CASE EXPERIENCE. WITH THE INPUT OF THIS GROUP, WE ARE CRAFTING A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING FLOWS OF INFLUENCE, CRITERIA FOR Ã‚  SUCCESSFULÃ‚   DEI INTERVENTION, AND THE ENVISIONED SCOPE OF SOCIAL CHANGE ACROSS ADRP-CERTIFICATION ASPIRANTS. WE WILL THEN SHAPE A PLATFORM FOR ENACTING ADRP CERTIFICATION AS A PROCESS THAT ENACTS THE Ã‚  VERTICAL TEAMÃ‚   OR Ã‚  VERTICAL LEARNING COMMUNITYÃ‚   MODEL WE INITIALLY IMAGINED FOR OUR ENG PLUS RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION.
 TO DO SO, WE WOULD CREATE PLATFORMS THROUGH WHICH ENGINEERING DEANS; ESTABLISHED FACULTY OR ADMIN; AND EARLY-CAREER RESEARCHERS, STAFF, FACULTY OR OTHERS COULD MOVE TOGETHER BEYOND INTENTION TO ENACTING CHANGE. THIS VERTICALITY (IE, INTEGRATING MULTIPLE LEVELS OF VOICE AND EXPERIENCE) MAPS WELL ONTO THE ASEE DEANS COUNCIL, HUBS INSTITUTION REPRESENTATIVES, AND STEM PEERS ACADEMY PARTICIPANTS Ã‚  ALL GROUPS ALREADY BEING CONVENED BY ENG PLUS.

 OVER THE PAST DECADE, NAMIBIA HAS MADE IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS. THE RECENT NAMPHIA STUDY SHOWS THAT OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLHIV) AGED 15-64 YEARS, 86% REPORTED KNOWING THEIR HIV STATUS, AND ONCE DIAGNOSED OVER 90% OF PLHIV WERE LINKED TO ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) AND VIRALLY SUPPRESSED. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF NAMIBIA (GRN) HAS TAKEN DECISIVE STEPS TO SCALE UP BEST PRACTICES, INCLUDING INTEGRATING PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP) INTO THE NATIONAL ART GUIDELINES, INCREASING HIV TESTING ACCESS AND YIELD THROUGH TARGETED INDEX PARTNER TESTING AND HIV SELF-TESTING AND INTRODUCING COMMUNITY-BASED ART MODELS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED HIGH RETENTION RATES.
 
 DESPITE THIS PROGRESS, KEY AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONSÃ‚  PARTICULARLY SEX WORKERS (SWS), MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN (MSM), AND TRANSGENDER (TG) WOMENÃ‚  CONTINUE TO BE LEFT BEHIND. OVERALL HIV PREVALENCE AMONG ADULTS 15-49 STANDS AT 11.8% BUT RISES TO 53.2% AMONG SWS IN KATIMA MULILO AND KEETMANSHOOP AND 20.9% AMONG MSM IN WINDHOEK. WHILE LITTLE DATA ON TG MEN OR WOMEN ARE AVAILABLE, THE PLACE STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES (MOHSS) IN WINDHOEK FOUND THAT TG WOMEN REPORTED THE LOWEST RATES OF HIV TESTING AT 12%, COMPARED TO 30% AND 57% FOR FEMALE SWS (FSWS) AND MSM, RESPECTIVELY. TREATMENT COVERAGE FOR KEY POPULATIONS (KPS) WAS LOW (33.7% OF HIV-INFECTED FSWS AND 15% OF HIV-INFECTED MSM) WITH SIGNIFICANT LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP ALONG THE CONTINUUM OF HIV PREVENTION, CARE AND TREATMENT, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE RISK OF HIV TRANSMISSION OR REINFECTION OF HIV POSITIVE SEX PARTNERS. 
 
 RECENT DATA FROM IBBS STUDY DONE IN 2019 AT THREE SELECTED SITES OF KATIMA MULILO, WINDHOEK, WALVIS BAY & SWAKOPMUND HAS SHOWN THAT HIV PREVALENCE AMONG YOUNG FSW AGED 18-24 YEARS, A PROXY FOR HIV INCIDENCE, HAS REMAINED HIGH AND RANGES FROM 4.8% TO 27.4%. THERE IS A HIGH SYPHILIS PREVALENCE 8.9% AMONG FSW AND 30% OF KPS REPORTED NEVER USING A CONDOM, BOTH DATA POINTS INDICATING LOW UPTAKE OF PREVENTION INITIATIVES AND PERCEIVED RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION BY KP COMMUNITY. THE IBBS 2019 STUDY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE HIV VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION AMONG KPS REMAINS AT ALL STUDY SITES WITH 77.2%, 69.4% AND 28.3% AT WINDHOEK, KATIMA MULILO AND WALVIS BAY/SWAKOPMUND RESPECTIVELY. 
 
 THE KEY CHALLENGES FACING KPS INCLUDE HIGH RATES OF STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION (S&D) AND VIOLENCE AGAINST KPS; WEAK BIDIRECTIONAL LINKAGES/REFERRAL MECHANISMS BETWEEN COMMUNITY AND HEALTH FACILITY-BASED SERVICES; LACK OF KPSÃ‚   KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIV AND THEIR RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION AND HOW TO ACCESS SERVICES AND SUPPORT; AND A LACK OF HOLISTIC RESILIENCY AND RISK REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS.

 UNDER KP-STAR, KPS WILL BENEFIT FROM SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF INTERVENTIONS SO THAT HIV TRANSMISSION IS REDUCED, AND PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV OBTAIN EARLY ACCESS TO SERVICES. OUR IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK PRIORITIZES KEY AREAS ALONG THE CASCADE THAT REQUIRE CONCENTRATED ATTENTION, INCLUDING TARGETED, HIGH-YIELD HTS APPROACHES; EARLY/SAME-DAY INITIATION ON ART; AND THE EXPANSION OF DIFFERENTIATED SERVICE DELIVERY (DSD) MODELS FOR KPS.

OVERALL HIV PREVALENCE AMONG ADULTS 15-49 STANDS AT 11.8% BUT RISES TO 53.2% AMONG SWS IN KATIMA MULILO AND KEETMANSHOOP AND 20.9% AMONG MSM IN WINDHOEK. WHILE LITTLE DATA ON TG MEN OR WOMEN ARE AVAILABLE, THE PLACE STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES (MOHSS) IN WINDHOEK FOUND THAT TG WOMEN REPORTED THE LOWEST RATES OF HIV TESTING AT 12%, COMPARED TO 30% AND 57% FOR FEMALE SWS (FSWS) AND MSM, RESPECTIVELY. TREATMENT COVERAGE FOR KEY POPULATIONS (KPS) WAS LOW (33.7% OF HIV-INFECTED FSWS AND 15% OF HIV-INFECTED MSM) WITH SIGNIFICANT LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP ALONG THE CONTINUUM OF HIV PREVENTION, CARE AND TREATMENT, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE RISK OF HIV TRANSMISSION OR REINFECTION OF HIV POSITIVE SEX PARTNERS. 
 
 RECENT DATA FROM IBBS STUDY DONE IN 2019 AT THREE SELECTED SITES OF KATIMA MULILO, WINDHOEK, WALVIS BAY & SWAKOPMUND HAS SHOWN THAT HIV PREVALENCE AMONG YOUNG FSW AGED 18-24 YEARS, A PROXY FOR HIV INCIDENCE, HAS REMAINED HIGH AND RANGES FROM 4.8% TO 27.4%. THERE IS A HIGH SYPHILIS PREVALENCE 8.9% AMONG FSW AND 30% OF KPS REPORTED NEVER USING A CONDOM, BOTH DATA POINTS INDICATING LOW UPTAKE OF PREVENTION INITIATIVES AND PERCEIVED RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION BY KP COMMUNITY. THE IBBS 2019 STUDY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE HIV VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION AMONG KPS REMAINS AT ALL STUDY SITES WITH 77.2%, 69.4% AND 28.3% AT WINDHOEK, KATIMA MULILO AND WALVIS BAY/SWAKOPMUND RESPECTIVELY. 
 
 THE KEY CHALLENGES FACING KPS INCLUDE HIGH RATES OF STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION (S&D) AND VIOLENCE AGAINST KPS; WEAK BIDIRECTIONAL LINKAGES/REFERRAL MECHANISMS BETWEEN COMMUNITY AND HEALTH FACILITY-BASED SERVICES; LACK OF KPSÃ‚   KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIV AND THEIR RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION AND HOW TO ACCESS SERVICES AND SUPPORT; AND A LACK OF HOLISTIC RESILIENCY AND RISK REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS. ACHIEVING AND SUSTAINING EPIDEMIC CONTROL IN NAMIBIA WILL REQUIRE A RAPID ACCELERATION OF THE HIV RESPONSE FOR KPS, USING COORDINATED, DATA-DRIVEN APPROACHES AT SCALE TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE MAJOR BIOMEDICAL, STRUCTURAL, AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS THAT INCREASE KPSÃ‚   VULNERABILITY TO HIV, ALONGSIDE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT OF KP-LED AND KP-SERVING ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO REACH THESE MOST HARD-TO-REACH POPULATIONS.
 
 UNDER KP-STAR, KPS WILL BENEFIT FROM SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF INTERVENTIONS SO THAT HIV TRANSMISSION IS REDUCED, AND PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV OBTAIN EARLY ACCESS TO SERVICES. OUR IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK PRIORITIZES KEY AREAS ALONG THE CASCADE THAT REQUIRE CONCENTRATED ATTENTION, INCLUDING TARGETED, HIGH-YIELD HTS APPROACHES; EARLY/SAME-DAY INITIATION ON ART; AND THE EXPANSION OF DIFFERENTIATED SERVICE DELIVERY (DSD) MODELS FOR KPS.

 OVER THE PAST DECADE, NAMIBIA HAS MADE IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS. THE RECENT NAMPHIA STUDY SHOWS THAT OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLHIV) AGED 15-64 YEARS, 86% REPORTED KNOWING THEIR HIV STATUS, AND ONCE DIAGNOSED OVER 90% OF PLHIV WERE LINKED TO ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) AND VIRALLY SUPPRESSED.

 OVER THE PAST DECADE, NAMIBIA HAS MADE IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS. THE RECENT NAMPHIA STUDY SHOWS THAT OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLHIV) AGED 15-64 YEARS, 86% REPORTED KNOWING THEIR HIV STATUS, AND ONCE DIAGNOSED OVER 90% OF PLHIV WERE LINKED TO ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) AND VIRALLY SUPPRESSED. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF NAMIBIA (GRN) HAS TAKEN DECISIVE STEPS TO SCALE UP BEST PRACTICES, INCLUDING INTEGRATING PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP) INTO THE NATIONAL ART GUIDELINES, INCREASING HIV TESTING ACCESS AND YIELD THROUGH TARGETED INDEX PARTNER TESTING AND HIV SELF-TESTING AND INTRODUCING COMMUNITY-BASED ART MODELS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED HIGH RETENTION RATES.
 
 DESPITE THIS PROGRESS, KEY AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONSÃ‚  PARTICULARLY SEX WORKERS (SWS), MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN (MSM), AND TRANSGENDER (TG) WOMENÃ‚  CONTINUE TO BE LEFT BEHIND. OVERALL HIV PREVALENCE AMONG ADULTS 15-49 STANDS AT 11.8% BUT RISES TO 53.2% AMONG SWS IN KATIMA MULILO AND KEETMANSHOOP AND 20.9% AMONG MSM IN WINDHOEK. WHILE LITTLE DATA ON TG MEN OR WOMEN ARE AVAILABLE, THE PLACE STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES (MOHSS) IN WINDHOEK FOUND THAT TG WOMEN REPORTED THE LOWEST RATES OF HIV TESTING AT 12%, COMPARED TO 30% AND 57% FOR FEMALE SWS (FSWS) AND MSM, RESPECTIVELY. TREATMENT COVERAGE FOR KEY POPULATIONS (KPS) WAS LOW (33.7% OF HIV-INFECTED FSWS AND 15% OF HIV-INFECTED MSM) WITH SIGNIFICANT LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP ALONG THE CONTINUUM OF HIV PREVENTION, CARE AND TREATMENT, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE RISK OF HIV TRANSMISSION OR REINFECTION OF HIV POSITIVE SEX PARTNERS. 
 
 RECENT DATA FROM IBBS STUDY DONE IN 2019 AT THREE SELECTED SITES OF KATIMA MULILO, WINDHOEK, WALVIS BAY & SWAKOPMUND HAS SHOWN THAT HIV PREVALENCE AMONG YOUNG FSW AGED 18-24 YEARS, A PROXY FOR HIV INCIDENCE, HAS REMAINED HIGH AND RANGES FROM 4.8% TO 27.4%. THERE IS A HIGH SYPHILIS PREVALENCE 8.9% AMONG FSW AND 30% OF KPS REPORTED NEVER USING A CONDOM, BOTH DATA POINTS INDICATING LOW UPTAKE OF PREVENTION INITIATIVES AND PERCEIVED RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION BY KP COMMUNITY. THE IBBS 2019 STUDY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE HIV VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION AMONG KPS REMAINS AT ALL STUDY SITES WITH 77.2%, 69.4% AND 28.3% AT WINDHOEK, KATIMA MULILO AND WALVIS BAY/SWAKOPMUND RESPECTIVELY. 
 
 THE KEY CHALLENGES FACING KPS INCLUDE HIGH RATES OF STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION (S&D) AND VIOLENCE AGAINST KPS; WEAK BIDIRECTIONAL LINKAGES/REFERRAL MECHANISMS BETWEEN COMMUNITY AND HEALTH FACILITY-BASED SERVICES; LACK OF KPSÃ‚   KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIV AND THEIR RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION AND HOW TO ACCESS SERVICES AND SUPPORT; AND A LACK OF HOLISTIC RESILIENCY AND RISK REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS. ACHIEVING AND SUSTAINING EPIDEMIC CONTROL IN NAMIBIA WILL REQUIRE A RAPID ACCELERATION OF THE HIV RESPONSE FOR KPS, USING COORDINATED, DATA-DRIVEN APPROACHES AT SCALE TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE MAJOR BIOMEDICAL, STRUCTURAL, AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS THAT INCREASE KPSÃ‚   VULNERABILITY TO HIV, ALONGSIDE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT OF KP-LED AND KP-SERVING ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO REACH THESE MOST HARD-TO-REACH POPULATIONS.
 
 UNDER KP-STAR, KPS WILL BENEFIT FROM SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF INTERVENTIONS SO THAT HIV TRANSMISSION IS REDUCED, AND PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV OBTAIN EARLY ACCESS TO SERVICES. OUR IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK PRIORITIZES KEY AREAS ALONG THE CASCADE THAT REQUIRE CONCENTRATED ATTENTION, INCLUDING TARGETED, HIGH-YIELD HTS APPROACHES; EARLY/SAME-DAY INITIATION ON ART; AND THE EXPANSION OF DIFFERENTIATED SERVICE DELIVERY (DSD) MODELS FOR KPS.

 OVER THE PAST DECADE, NAMIBIA HAS MADE IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS. THE RECENT NAMPHIA STUDY SHOWS THAT OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLHIV) AGED 15-64 YEARS, 86% REPORTED KNOWING THEIR HIV STATUS, AND ONCE DIAGNOSED OVER 90% OF PLHIV WERE LINKED TO ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) AND VIRALLY SUPPRESSED. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF NAMIBIA (GRN) HAS TAKEN DECISIVE STEPS TO SCALE UP BEST PRACTICES, INCLUDING INTEGRATING PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP) INTO THE NATIONAL ART GUIDELINES, INCREASING HIV TESTING ACCESS AND YIELD THROUGH TARGETED INDEX PARTNER TESTING AND HIV SELF-TESTING AND INTRODUCING COMMUNITY-BASED ART MODELS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED HIGH RETENTION RATES.
 
 DESPITE THIS PROGRESS, KEY AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONSÃ‚  PARTICULARLY SEX WORKERS (SWS), MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN (MSM), AND TRANSGENDER (TG) WOMENÃ‚  CONTINUE TO BE LEFT BEHIND. OVERALL HIV PREVALENCE AMONG ADULTS 15-49 STANDS AT 11.8% BUT RISES TO 53.2% AMONG SWS IN KATIMA MULILO AND KEETMANSHOOP AND 20.9% AMONG MSM IN WINDHOEK. WHILE LITTLE DATA ON TG MEN OR WOMEN ARE AVAILABLE, THE PLACE STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES (MOHSS) IN WINDHOEK FOUND THAT TG WOMEN REPORTED THE LOWEST RATES OF HIV TESTING AT 12%, COMPARED TO 30% AND 57% FOR FEMALE SWS (FSWS) AND MSM, RESPECTIVELY. TREATMENT COVERAGE FOR KEY POPULATIONS (KPS) WAS LOW (33.7% OF HIV-INFECTED FSWS AND 15% OF HIV-INFECTED MSM) WITH SIGNIFICANT LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP ALONG THE CONTINUUM OF HIV PREVENTION, CARE AND TREATMENT, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE RISK OF HIV TRANSMISSION OR REINFECTION OF HIV POSITIVE SEX PARTNERS. 
 
 RECENT DATA FROM IBBS STUDY DONE IN 2019 AT THREE SELECTED SITES OF KATIMA MULILO, WINDHOEK, WALVIS BAY & SWAKOPMUND HAS SHOWN THAT HIV PREVALENCE AMONG YOUNG FSW AGED 18-24 YEARS, A PROXY FOR HIV INCIDENCE, HAS REMAINED HIGH AND RANGES FROM 4.8% TO 27.4%. THERE IS A HIGH SYPHILIS PREVALENCE 8.9% AMONG FSW AND 30% OF KPS REPORTED NEVER USING A CONDOM, BOTH DATA POINTS INDICATING LOW UPTAKE OF PREVENTION INITIATIVES AND PERCEIVED RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION BY KP COMMUNITY. THE IBBS 2019 STUDY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE HIV VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION AMONG KPS REMAINS AT ALL STUDY SITES WITH 77.2%, 69.4% AND 28.3% AT WINDHOEK, KATIMA MULILO AND WALVIS BAY/SWAKOPMUND RESPECTIVELY. 
 
 THE KEY CHALLENGES FACING KPS INCLUDE HIGH RATES OF STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION (S&D) AND VIOLENCE AGAINST KPS; WEAK BIDIRECTIONAL LINKAGES/REFERRAL MECHANISMS BETWEEN COMMUNITY AND HEALTH FACILITY-BASED SERVICES; LACK OF KPSÃ‚   KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIV AND THEIR RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION AND HOW TO ACCESS SERVICES AND SUPPORT; AND A LACK OF HOLISTIC RESILIENCY AND RISK REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS. ACHIEVING AND SUSTAINING EPIDEMIC CONTROL IN NAMIBIA WILL REQUIRE A RAPID ACCELERATION OF THE HIV RESPONSE FOR KPS, USING COORDINATED, DATA-DRIVEN APPROACHES AT SCALE TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE MAJOR BIOMEDICAL, STRUCTURAL, AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS THAT INCREASE KPSÃ‚   VULNERABILITY TO HIV, ALONGSIDE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT OF KP-LED AND KP-SERVING ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO REACH THESE MOST HARD-TO-REACH POPULATIONS.
 
 UNDER KP-STAR, KPS WILL BENEFIT FROM SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF INTERVENTIONS SO THAT HIV TRANSMISSION IS REDUCED, AND PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV OBTAIN EARLY ACCESS TO SERVICES. OUR IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK PRIORITIZES KEY AREAS ALONG THE CASCADE THAT REQUIRE CONCENTRATED ATTENTION, INCLUDING TARGETED, HIGH-YIELD HTS APPROACHES; EARLY/SAME-DAY INITIATION ON ART; AND THE EXPANSION OF DIFFERENTIATED SERVICE DELIVERY (DSD) MODELS FOR KPS.

VIA TELEMEDICINE THAT CAN BE ACCESSED FROM HOME AND ALMOST ALL DEVICES, MONTANA PEDIATRICS HAS INCREASED ACCESS TO PEDIATRIC SPECIFIC CARE BY ABOUT 5900 HOURS PER YEAR. OUR MISSION COUPLED WITH DONOR RESOURCES ENSURES THAT WE MEET FAMILIES WHERE THEY ARE IN THEIR TIME OF NEED AND CAN OFFER SERVICES TO CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF THE FAMILYÃ‚  S ABILITY TO PAY. OUR TELEMEDICINE OFFERING IS ALSO HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED FROM THE Ã‚  CONVENIENCE CAREÃ‚   MODELS THAT CLAIM TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE IN THAT WE ARE UNIQUELY SITUATED TO BE A SOLUTION FOR CHILDREN WITH MEDICAL COMPLEXITY. OUR PROVIDERS HAVE WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR CMC ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL AS CONNECTIONS TO ONE ANOTHER VIA MONTANA PEDIATRICS, EMPOWERING OUR PROVIDERS TO MAKE TELEMEDICINE A VIABLE, SAFE AND HIGH-QUALITY OPTION EVEN FOR TECHNOLOGY-DEPENDENT CHILDREN OR THOSE WITH COMPLEXITIES THAT ARE REJECTED BY OTHER ACCESS MODELS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT CHILDREN WITH MEDICAL COMPLEXITY NEED CONVENIENCE MORE THAN ANY OTHER PEDIATRIC POPULATION.

 BACKGROUND: THE FEED THE FUTURE INNOVATION LAB FOR HORTICULTURE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS (UC DAVIS) WILL IMPLEMENT RESEARCH PROJECTS IN THE HORTICULTURE SECTOR IN FOUR DIFFERENT REGIONS Ã‚   EAST AFRICA, WEST AFRICA, SOUTH/SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND CENTRAL AMERICA. THE RESEARCH WILL START IN MARCH 2023 AND END IN SEPTEMBER 2026. PROJECTS WILL BE MARKET-ORIENTED, WITH ADDITIONAL FOCUS ON GENDER EQUITY, YOUTH ENGAGEMENT, AND NUTRITION. THE PROJECTS WILL BE LED BY LOCAL EXPERTS AND ORGANIZATIONS, WITH SUPPORT FROM THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LABÃ‚  S MANAGEMENT ENTITY AND ITS CONSORTIUM Ã‚   FLORIDA AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL UNIVERSITY, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY, TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY, AND THE WORLD VEGETABLE CENTER Ã‚   AND SPECIALISTS IN GENDER, YOUTH, AND NUTRITION. TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THESE RESEARCH PROJECTS, THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB WILL ESTABLISH FOUR REGIONAL HUBS Ã‚   ONE PER REGION Ã‚   THAT WILL HOST A REGIONAL HUB MANAGER. THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL OPERATE ON-THE-GROUND AS PROGRAM COORDINATORS, NETWORKERS, MONITORS, EVALUATORS, AND DISSEMINATORS OF INFORMATION.
 THE OBJECTIVES OF THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB ARE: 
 Ã‚ Â¢ OBJECTIVE 1: DEVELOP CAPACITY OF LOCAL NETWORKS TO EQUITABLY RESPOND TO REGIONAL NEEDS
 Ã‚ Â¢ OBJECTIVE 2: SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESILIENT HORTICULTURAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
 Ã‚ Â¢ OBJECTIVE 3: SUPPORT INCLUSIVE, SUSTAINABLE HORTICULTURAL ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION WITHIN SMALLHOLDER SYSTEMS
 Ã‚ Â¢ OBJECTIVE 4: PROMOTE A WELL-NOURISHED POPULATION THROUGH AVAILABILITY, ACCESS AND CONSUMPTION OF SAFE, NUTRITIOUS HORTICULTURAL CROPS 
 Ã‚ Â¢ OBJECTIVE 5: FACILITATE THE EXCHANGE OF INNOVATIVE IDEAS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO CONTRIBUTE TO PRACTICAL AND ACADEMIC HORTICULTURAL PURSUITS.
 
 TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB WILL IMPLEMENT THREE TYPES OF RESEARCH PROJECTS. THE FIRST ARE MARKET ORIENTED RESEARCH FOR EMPOWERMENT (MORE) PROJECTS; ONE SET IN EACH REGION. THE SECOND ARE CRITICAL ENGAGEMENT PROJECTS THAT ARE TARGETED, SHORTER IN DURATION, AND MEANT TO FOCUS ON ACUTE RESEARCH NEEDS THAT CAN INFORM THE MORE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. FINALLY, THERE IS A HIGHER-EDUCATION CAPACITY BUILDING RESEARCH PROJECT CALLED THE TRELLIS FELLOWSHIP FUND, THAT WILL LINK U.S.-BASED GRADUATE STUDENTS AND IN-COUNTRY GRADUATE STUDENTS TO TOGETHER IN ORDER TO CONDUCT SMALL-SCALE RESEARCH PROJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE PROJECT ACTIVITIES. 
 
 REGIONAL HUBS: THE REGIONAL HUBS WILL PRIMARILY SERVE AS A HOST FOR THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER BOTH IN TERMS OF PROVIDING AN OFFICE SPACE AND AS EMPLOYER OF THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER. FORWARD NEPAL WILL SERVE AS THE REGIONAL HUB FOR SOUTH ASIA. REGIONAL HUBS, AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL, SHOULD BE GEOGRAPHICALLY AND OPERATIONALLY ESTABLISHED IN A WAY THAT FACILITATES THE NETWORKING CAPACITY OF THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER. POTENTIALLY, REGIONAL HUBS WILL BE LOCATIONS WHERE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB PROGRAM STAKEHOLDERS CONVENE FOR MEETINGS, BUT THIS CAPACITY IS NOT A NECESSITY. FOR FACILITATING THIS ROLE IN SOUTH ASIA, THE REGIONAL HUB WILL BE BASED IN KATHMANDU, NEPAL.
 REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS:  IN EACH REGIONAL HUB, THERE WILL BE A REGIONAL HUB MANAGER THAT WILL BECOME AN EMPLOYEE OF THE REGIONAL HUB, BUT ALSO BE CONSIDERED A PART OF THE MANAGEMENT ENTITY OF THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB. MR. KRISHNA PRASAD SAPKOTA HAS BEEN ASSIGNED AS THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER FOR SOUTH ASIA. MR SAPKOTA WILL LIVE IN-COUNTRY (NEPAL) AND COORDINATE AND MONITOR PROJECTS AND TRAININGS, INTRODUCE AND ADVOCATE FOR NEW INNOVATIONS, AS WELL AS CULTIVATE IN-COUNTRY NETWORKS INCLUDING USAID MISSION RELATIONSHIPS. ACROSS ALL REGIONS, THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL BE TASKED AND SUPPORTED TO NOT ONLY ENGAGE IN THE FIELD WITH IMPLEMENTERS, BUT ALSO TO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS OR END-USERS TO COLLECT INSIGHTS INTO THE EFFECTIVENESS AND PROGRESS OF RESEARCH. ULTIMATELY, THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL BE THE ON-THE-GROUND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB. 
 PROJECT MONITORING: MR. SAPKOTA WILL COORDINATE WITH HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB PROJECTS IN THE REGION TO ASSIST THE MANAGEMENT ENTITY IN TRACKING THEIR RESEARCH PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING PROGRAM AND PROJECT OBJECTIVES. THIS COORDINATION INCLUDES ASSISTING RESEARCH PROJECTS TO ADAPT IN ORDER TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES OR ADDRESS HIGH PRIORITY OPPORTUNITIES. PROJECT MONITORING FOR THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER ADDITIONALLY INVOLVES HELPING PROJECTS REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH USAID GUIDELINES AND THE NEED TO SUBMIT REQUIRED DATA, REPORTS, AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT, AS NEEDED, BY BOTH USAID AND UC DAVIS. FINALLY, THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER WILL SUPPORT PROJECT CAPACITY TO CONDUCT RIGOROUS RESEARCH.
 COMMUNICATION: THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL CONSISTENTLY CONNECT THE CONSORTIUM WITH A NETWORK OF LOCAL EXPERTS, LEADERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS. THE PURPOSES OF THIS NETWORKING INCLUDE: TO GATHER GUIDANCE ON THE DOWNSTREAM NEEDS OF STAKEHOLDERS AND END-USERS OF INNOVATION; TO BROADLY SHARE RESULTS AND INFORMATION FROM RESEARCH PROJECTS; AND TO FACILITATE COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN KEY ACTORS IN THE REGIONAL RESEARCH PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY, THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER WILL ROUTINELY COMMUNICATE WITH USAID MISSIONS IN THE REGION TO UPDATE THEM ON PROGRESS AND TO LEARN ABOUT FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB COULD PURSUE. 
 THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER WILL MAINTAIN ROUTINE COMMUNICATION WITH UC DAVIS, AND THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB CONSORTIUM AND SPECIALISTS. AS PART OF THIS EXPECTATION FOR COMMUNICATION, THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER WILL PROVIDE FREQUENT UPDATES REGARDING RESEARCH PROGRESS TOWARD PROJECT MILESTONES. 
 REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL SUPPORT UC DAVIS AND PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS IN THE REGION WITH DRAFTING NECESSARY USAID REPORTS (SEMI-ANNUAL AND ANNUAL REPORTS) AND INFORMATION DELIVERABLES SUCH AS EXTENSION BULLETINS AND TRAINING MANUALS. REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL ALSO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE DISSEMINATION OF THESE INFORMATION DELIVERABLES TO INTERMEDIARY ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER STAKEHOLDERS. 
 REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS TO GATHER LESSONS LEARNED FROM PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND SHARE INFORMATION/RESULTS THAT COULD BE APPLICABLE FOR OTHER REGIONS WHERE THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB IS OPERATING. 
 IMPLEMENTATION OF MANAGEMENT ENTITY ACTIVITIES: TANGENTIAL TO THE RESEARCH PROJECT ACTIVITIES LED BY LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AND EXPERTS, THE MANAGEMENT ENTITY FOR THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB WILL HAVE ACTIVITIES THAT WILL BOTH BENEFIT FROM INPUT FROM LOCAL EXPERTISE AT THE REGIONAL HUB AND WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON-THE-GROUND BY REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS. AS AN EXAMPLE, THESE ACTIVITIES COULD INCLUDE THE BUILDING OF WEB-BASED TOOLS FOR RESEARCHERS AND STAKEHOLDERS IN THE HORTICULTURE SECTOR. SPECIFICALLY, INFORMATIONAL VIDEOS COULD BE PRODUCED AND MATERIALS REFINED TO BE APPLICABLE TO LOCAL CULTURAL CONDITIONS. ESSENTIALLY, THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER, AS PART OF THE MANAGEMENT ENTITY, WILL BE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE AND LEAD IN ACTIVITIES THAT HELP THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES. 
 ANNUAL MEETING COORDINATION: ANNUAL HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LAB MEETINGS WILL BE HELD ON A ROTATING BASIS. DURING THE FOUR YEARS OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, AN ANNUAL MEETING WILL BE HELD ONCE IN EACH REGION. THE ANNUAL MEETING WILL BRING TOGETHER THE MANAGEMENT ENTITY, THE CONSORTIUM (INCLUDING SPECIALISTS), PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS, THE INTERNATIONAL ADVISORY BOARD, AND KEY REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVES. IN THE ANNUAL MEETINGS, RESEARCH PROGRESS, RESULTS AND LESSONS LEARNED WILL BE DISCUSSED AND SHARED ACROSS PROJECTS. REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN COORDINATING THE LOGISTICS FOR THESE MEETINGS WHEN THE ANNUAL MEETING IS OCCURRING IN THEIR RESPECTIVE REGION. IN ROTATION, SOUTH ASIA WILL ALSO PLAN TO HOST A MEETING IN NEPAL IN COORDINATION WITH THE MANAGEMENT ENTITY AND UC DAVIS.
 STRUCTURE: AS PART OF THE MANAGEMENT ENTITY, THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL BE BOTH A LEADER AND AN INTERMEDIARY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HORTICULTURE INNOVATION LABÃ‚  S ACTIVITIES. REGIONAL HUB MANAGERS WILL NETWORK AND CONVEY INFORMATION ACROSS SEVERAL PARTIES, AND WILL ALSO BECOME A RESOURCE THAT MULTIPLE PARTIES RELY UPON FOR GUIDANCE AND INSIGHT. UC DAVIS WILL HAVE DIRECT CONTACT WITH PIS, USAID MISSIONS, AND LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL, BUT WILL RELY ON THE REGIONAL HUB MANAGER TO BE KEY LOCAL NETWORK HUB.",assistance_sub,11/18/2024,11/18/2024,0,Single Action,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Small ($10K - $100K),1,6

 4. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 A. PURPOSE OR OBJECTIVE(S) OF THE WORK TO BE PERFORMED;
 THIS STUDY WILL ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERPERSONAL DISCRIMINATION, NEIGHBORHOOD-LEVEL DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK. OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVE IS TO GENERATE NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE MECHANISMS LINKING DISCRIMINATION EXPOSURE TO DISPROPORTIONATE TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2D) RISK IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS IN THE US. INVESTIGATORS AT THE ARNOLD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, AND LEADERS OF THE COUNCIL ON BLACK HEALTH WILL BLEND THEIR COMPLEMENTARY EXPERTISE TO ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS IN AN EXISTING LONGITUDINAL DATASET, THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT STUDY (ABCD) - A LARGE AND RACIALLY DIVERSE POPULATION-BASED COHORT WITH AN EXTENSIVE ARRAY OF PSYCHOSOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES AND BIOMARKERS:
 
  AIM 1: ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AND T2D RISK IN THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (ABCD) COHORT.
 TO ACCOMPLISH THIS AIM, WE WILL ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION (NEIGHBORHOOD AND INTERPERSONAL) AND TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK [A) CHILDÃ‚  S MEAN HBA1C LEVEL AND B) BINARY INDICATOR OF T2D DIAGNOSIS IF HBA1C Ã‚ Â¥ 6.5% (8 MMOL/MOL).] HYPOTHESIS 1.A: INCREASED DISCRIMINATION IS LINKED TO HIGHER MEAN HBA1C LEVELS AND ELEVATED ODDS OF T2D DIAGNOSIS.
 
 AIM 2: EXTENT TO WHICH MULTIPLE FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION ACCOUNT FOR RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN T2D RISK IN THE ABCD COHORT. 
 TO ACCOMPLISH THIS AIM, WE WILL USE OAXACA BLINDER DECOMPOSITION TO EXAMINE THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH FORM OF DISCRIMINATION EXPOSURE IN EXPLAINING DISPARITIES IN T2D RISK BETWEEN RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUPS. HYPOTHESIS 2: DIFFERENTIAL EXPOSURE TO DISCRIMINATION EXPLAINS A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN T2D RISK.
 
  AIM 3: INVESTIGATE MEDIATING HEALTH BEHAVIORS IN THE ABCD COHORT.
 IN THIS AIM, WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER HEALTH BEHAVIORS (I.E., DIET QUALITY, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND SCREEN TIME UTILIZATION) MEDIATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISCRIMINATION AND T2D RISK. HYPOTHESIS 3: HEALTH BEHAVIORS AT WILL MEDIATE THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN DISCRIMINATION EXPOSURE AND T2D RISK.

GR135739,THE TOLEDO ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY,Department of Commerce (DOC),"$99,974.00 ",12/6/2024,"A MAJOR GOAL FOR THE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) DISCIPLINES HAS BEEN TO
 ATTRACT STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS. INCREASED SOCIOCULTURAL DIVERSITY CAN RESULT
 IN BROADENED SCIENTIFIC IMPACT AND INQUIRY TO INCLUDE TOPICS OF INTEREST TO A LARGER PORTION OF SOCIETY.
 HOWEVER, RETENTION OF STUDENTS IN PURSUIT OF BIOLOGY OR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE DEGREES DISPROPORTIONALLY
 AFFECTS MINORITY GROUPS. FIELD-BASED INTERNSHIPS AND TECHNICIAN POSITIONS CAN PROVIDE TRANSFORMATIVE
 EXPERIENCES FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN PURSUING CAREERS IN STEM FIELDS BY OFFERING IMPORTANT CAREER
 ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, SOME OF THE SAME ELEMENTS THAT DEFINE THESE EXPERIENCES MAY ALSO
 LIMIT ACCESSIBILITY TO UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. BARRIERS TO DIVERSITY IN FIELD BIOLOGY INCLUDE COST,
 SCHEDULING, INFORMATION, SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT, AND LACK OF ROLE MODELS.
 TO ADDRESS THESE EQUITY ISSUES WITHIN THE FIELD OF CONSERVATION BIOLOGY, WE TESTED PILOT PROGRAM, WHEREIN
 THE TOLEDO ZOO PROVIDED SIX LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH UNIQUE, HANDS-ON EXPERIENCES BY INTEGRATING
 THEM INTO OUR EXISTING CONSERVATION TEAM, WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH PROJECTS IN
 NORTHWEST OHIO. OUR APPROACH WAS TO REDUCE ANY DISPARITIES IN THE HIRING PROCESS BY ELIMINATING BARRIERS
 TO LANGUAGE, DISABILITY, OR EDUCATION LEVEL BY WORKING WITH TEACHERS TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS WHO HAVE
 EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN THE CONSERVATION FIELD, OR WHO THEY FELT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS EXPERIENCE. WE
 ADDRESSED OTHER BARRIERS TO INCLUSION IN OUR FIELD BY PROVIDING STUDENTS PAID INTERNSHIPS, EQUIPMENT AND
 SUPPLIES FOR THE FIELD (I.E., WADERS, BOOTS, HATS, ETC.), TRANSPORTATION WHEN NECESSARY, AND MAINTAIN FLEXIBLE
 SCHEDULES TO ACCOMMODATE EXISTING RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMMITMENTS.
 TO INTEGRATE THE PROGRAM INTO OUR CONSERVATION DEPARTMENT, WE CHOSE TO EMBED THE PILOT INTO THE TOLEDO
 ZOO & AQUARIUMÃ‚  S LONG-STANDING TURTLE RESEARCH, PREDOMINANTLY FOCUSED ON LOCAL BLANDINGÃ‚  S TURTLE
 POPULATIONS. BLANDINGÃ‚  S TURTLE (EMYDOIDEA BLANDINGII) POPULATIONS ARE EXCEPTIONALLY VULNERABLE DUE TO
 HABITAT LOSS AND ELEVATED ADULT MORTALITY RATES. FILLING IN DATA AND KNOWLEDGE GAPS FOR THIS SPECIES IS A
 CONSERVATION PRIORITY AND THE EASE WITH WHICH TURTLES CAN BE HANDLED MAKES THEM AN IDEAL MODEL ORGANISM
 FOR OUR INTERN PROGRAM. THE TOLEDO ZOO HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTING A REGIONAL CONSERVATION PLAN AND
 IDENTIFYING HABITATS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THEIR SURVIVAL, AND PROTECTION OF GENETIC VARIATION. FINE-SCALE,
 INTENSIVE MONITORING ENABLES US TO ESTIMATE AND EVALUATE TRENDS IN POPULATION SIZE, STRUCTURE, AND DENSITY.
 THESE LONG-TERM SITES ALSO EVALUATE VARIATION IN SURVEY SUCCESS ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, SEASONS,
 AND YEARS.
 THIS PILOT PROVED TO BE A SUCCESSFUL WAY TO CREATE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO FIELD BIOLOGY AND CONNECT LOCAL HIGH
 SCHOOL STUDENTS TO LAKE ERIE WETLANDS. OUR PROGRAM OFFERED ON-THE-JOB LEARNING FOR NOT ONLY SKILLSCOMPETENCY,
 BUT ALSO REAL-TIME KNOWLEDGE GAINS ABOUT ECOLOGY, MARK-RECAPTURE TECHNIQUES, POPULATION
 ASSESSMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, AND WILDLIFE SUSTAINABILITY IN THE LAKE ERIE ECOSYSTEMS. THIS
 DISCOVERY-BASED ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION DURING THEIR INTERNSHIP RESULTED IN STUDENTS RETURNING TO
 CLASSROOMS WITH HEIGHTENED SCIENTIFIC LITERACY, HIGHER ENGAGEMENT, AND HIGHER ACADEMIC SCORES. DUE TO
 THIS SUCCESS, WE SEEK TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM.
 THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INCREASE DIVERSITY AND REPRESENTATION IN CONSERVATION BIOLOGY BY
 PROVIDING PAID WORK EXPERIENCE TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY EMPOWERING AN IDENTITY
 WITHIN OUR INTERNS AS CONSERVATION SCIENTISTS. THIS INTERNSHIP COINCIDES WITH PEAK ADOLESCENT YEARS WHEN A
 SENSE OF BELONGING IN STEM WILL DEVELOP AND PAVE THE WAY FOR CAREER DECISIONS AND EDUCATIONAL PURSUITS.

THE FLOOD RISKS AND THEIR IMPACTS ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND LIVELIHOODS SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION MOBILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY WILL BE ASSESSED WITH A FOCUS ON SOCIAL EQUITY; FOR EXAMPLE, LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN HIGH-RISK ZONES, FACE HIGHER DAMAGES, AND ARE LESS ABLE TO RECOVER. THE PROJECT WILL USE A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACTS AT TWO SCALES: (1) MACROSCOPIC SCALE (SUCH AS A TOWN OR CITY) USING GEOAI TOOLS, AND (2) MICROSCOPIC SCALE (SUCH AS A CENSUS TRACT) USING DIGITAL TWIN MODEL. GEOAI TOOLS INTEGRATE GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS WITH MACHINE LEARNING METHODS. IN THIS PROJECT, THE TOOL WILL INTEGRATE TIME-SERIES-BASED TRAFFIC, PRECIPITATION, AND HYDROLOGY DATA WITH THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATASETS ON MOBILITY AND DISADVANTAGE INDICES. THE CITY OF GREENSBORO IN NORTH CAROLINA WILL BE USED AS A TESTBED FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE GEOAI TOOL. FOR THE MICROSCOPIC SCALE OF ANALYSIS, A CENSUS TRACT WITH THE HIGHEST FLOOD RISK WILL BE ADOPTED FOR DIGITAL TWIN MODELING.

DURING THE FY2020 GRANT TERM, THE EFCN TEAM WAS ABLE TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE DRINKING WATER SAFETY AND RELIABILITY FOR OVER 3.5 MILLION PEOPLE THROUGH NEARLY 200 ONE-ON-ONE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EFFORTS.
 
 THE EFC WSU TEAM IS WELL-ROUNDED AND MULTI-DISCIPLINARY AND HAS PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD. EFC STAFF UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURES AND CHALLENGES TODAYÃ‚  S SMALL SYSTEMS FACE, AND THEY HAVE THE SKILLS, EXPERTISE, NETWORK, AND CAPABILITIES TO PROVIDE CUSTOMIZED SOLUTIONS THAT MEET SMALL SYSTEMS WHERE THEY ARE. THE EFC WSU FINDS THE RIGHT TEAM MEMBER TO FIT THE SYSTEMSÃ‚   NEEDS, AND WHEN NEEDED, THE EFC WILL ENGAGE WSU FACULTY OR EFCN PARTNERS TO PROVIDE THE PERFECT-FIT GUIDANCE OR SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY WE AIM TO SERVE.
 TECHNICAL, MANAGERIAL, AND FINANCIAL CAPACITY BUILDING FOR SMALL SYSTEMS IS INTEGRAL FOR REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND SYSTEM SUSTAINABILITY. EFC WSU WILL FOCUS ON VARIOUS WASTEWATER TOPICS THIS ROUND THAT INCREASE KNOWLEDGE FOR SMALL SYSTEMS IN THE AREAS OF ASSET MANAGEMENT, NUTRIENT REMOVAL, SYSTEM FINANCIAL WELLNESS, PRETREATMENT, FATS-OILS-GREASES, AND MORE.
 THE EFCÃ‚  S ROLE IS TO LISTEN AND RESPOND TO THE TARGET AUDIENCEÃ‚  S NEEDS, BARRIERS, OPPORTUNITIES, KNOWLEDGE GAPS, ETC.

THIS APPROACH ENSURES THAT THE EFC ENTERS NEW COMMUNITIES WITH A POSTURE OF LEARNING, COLLABORATION, AND SUPPORT Ã‚   RATHER THAN ONE OF AUTHORITY. THIS PROCESS BUILDS TRUST FOR WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE NEEDS SO SOLUTIONS CAN BE CUSTOMIZED AROUND ISSUES OF GREATEST CONCERN FOR THE COMMUNITY.

 PROBLEM STATEMENT AND GOALS
 THE NATIONAL EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY PLAN (2017) HIGHLIGHTS TECHNOLOGY AS A POWERFUL TOOL
 FOR TRANSFORMING LEARNING TO ADVANCE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS, REINVENT
 APPROACHES TO LEARNING AND COLLABORATION, SHRINK EQUITY AND ACCESSIBILITY GAPS, AND ADAPT
 INDIVIDUAL LEARNING NEEDS (U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, 2016). TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED TO
 TEACH ACADEMIC SKILLS ACROSS CONTENT AREAS BUT ALSO HAS A ROLE IN TEACHING SOCIAL SKILLS,
 COMMUNICATION SKILLS, AND ADAPTIVE BEHAVIORS. THESE DOMAINS ALL REPRESENT CORE DEFICITS
 ASSOCIATED WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD).
 THE INCREASED USE OF TECHNOLOGY-BASED INTERVENTIONS REFLECTS THE INCREASING ROLE OF
 TECHNOLOGY IN THE LIVES OF STUDENTS BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES. THE FAST-PACED GROWTH OF
 THE EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY MARKET SHOWS NO SIGNS OF DECELERATION AND HAS HELPED DEVELOP A
 MARKETPLACE BUSTING WITH NEW DEVICES, APPS, AND PROGRAMS MOST WITHOUT EMPIRICAL SUPPORT
 DEMONSTRATING EFFICACIOUS OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS, PARENTS, OR EDUCATORS. THUS, MAKING MEANINGFUL
 AND TARGETED RECOMMENDATIONS IS TENUOUS AT BEST.

 SOCIAL ROBOTICS TO IMPROVE THE SOCIAL SKILLS OF STUDENTS WITH ASD AND ID, (C) IMPROVE TEACHERSÃ‚  
 KNOWLEDGE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF SOCIAL ROBOTICS WITHIN STEM LESSONS AND PRACTICES TO BE PAIRED
 WITH EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION, AND (D) FINALIZE AND DISSEMINATE A SCALABLE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
 PROCESS TO SUPPORT TEACHERSÃ‚   IMPLEMENTATION OF EVIDENCE BASED SOCIAL ROBOTICS AND CORRESPONDING
